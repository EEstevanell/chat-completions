"""In the town they tell the story of the great pearl _ how it was found and how it was lost again."
"They tell of Kino, the fisherman, and of his wife, Juana, and of the baby, Coyotito."
"And because the story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man's mind."
The stars still shone and the day had drawn only a pale wash of light in the lower sky to the east.
"The roosters had been crowing for some time, and the early pigs were already beginning their ceaseless turning of twigs and bits of wood to see whether anything to eat had been overlooked."
"Outside the brush house in the tuna clump, a covey of little birds chittered and flurried with their wings."
"Kino's eyes opened, and he looked first at the lightening square which was the door and then he looked at the hanging box where Coyotito slept."
Juan's eyes were open too.
Kino could never remember seeing them closed when he awakened.
His people had once been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song.
That does not mean that there were no personal songs.
"In Kino's head there was a song now, clear and soft, and if he had been able to speak of it, he would have called it the Song of the Family."
Coyotito looked up for a moment and closed his eyes and slept again.
He saw the specks of Gulf clouds flame high in the air.
Behind him Juana's fire leaped into flame and threw spears of light through the chinks of the brushhouse wall and threw a wavering square of light out the door.
The Song of the Family came now from behind Kino.
And the rhythm of the family song was the grinding stone where Juana worked the corn for the morning cakes.
"The dawn came quickly now, a wash, a glow, a lightness, and then an explosion of fire as the sun arose out of the Gulf."
He could hear the pat of the corncakes in the house and the rich smell of them on the cooking plate.
"The ants were busy on the ground, big black ones with shiny bodies, and little dusty quick ants."
Kino watched with the detachment of God while a dusty ant frantically tried to escape the sand trap an ant lion had dug for him.
"A thin, timid dog came close and, at a soft word from Kino, curled up, arranged its tail neatly over its feet, and laid its chin delicately on the pile."
Kino heard the creak of the rope when Juana took Coyotito out of his hanging box and cleaned him and hammocked him in her shawl in a loop that placed him close to her breast.
Juana sang softly an ancient song that had only three notes and yet endless variety of interval.
"Across the brush fence were other brush houses, and the smoke came from them too, and the sound of breakfast, but those were other songs, their pigs were other pigs, their wives were not Juana."
They were not game chickens.
Kino watched them for a moment and then his eyes went up to a flight of wild doves twinkling inland to the hills.
"The world was awake now, and Kino arose and went into his brush house."
And he drank a little pulque and that was breakfast.
That was the only breakfast he had ever known outside of feast days and one incredible fiesta on cookies that had nearly killed him.
"They had spoken once, but there is not need for speech if it is only a habit anyway."
"The sun was warming the brush house, breaking through its crevices in long streaks."
It was a tiny movement that drew their eyes to the hanging box.
Down the rope that hung the baby's box from the roof support a scorpion moved slowly.
Kino's breath whistled in his nostrils and he opened his mouth to stop it.
And then the startled look was gone from him and the rigidity from his body.
"In his mind a new song had come, the Song of Evil, the music of the enemy, of any foe of the family, a savage, secret, dangerous melody, and underneath, the Song of the Family cried plaintively."
"His hands were in front of him, palms down, and his eyes were on the scorpion."
Kino stood perfectly still.
"He could hear Juana whispering the old magic again, and he could hear the evil music of the enemy."
"He could not move until the scorpion moved, and it felt for the source of the death that was coming to it."
"Kino's hand went forward very slowly, very smoothly."
And at that moment the laughing Coyotito shook the rope and the scorpion fell.
"Kino's hand leaped to catch it, but it fell past his fingers, fell on the baby's shoulder, landed and struck."
"He threw it down and beat it into the earth floor with his fist, and Coyotito screamed with pain in his box."
She put her lips down over the puncture and sucked hard and spat and sucked again while Coyotito screamed.
"Out of their brush houses they poured _ Kino's brother Juan Tomás and his fat wife Apolonia and their four children crowded in the door and blocked the entrance, while behind them others tried to look in, and one small boy crawled among legs to have a look."
"And those in front passed the word back to those behind _ ""Scorpion."
Juana stopped sucking the puncture for a moment.
"First, they knew, would come swelling and fever and tightened throat, and then cramps in the stomach, and then Coyotito might die if enough of the poison had gone in."
Coyotito's screams tuned to moans.
"She, who was obedient and respectful and cheerful and patient, she could arch her back in child pain with hardly a cry."
The doctor never came to the cluster of brush houses.
"Why should he, when he had more than he could do to take care of the rich people who lived in the stone and plaster houses of the town."
"""He would not come,"" the people in the door said, and the thought got into Kino."
This was Juana's first baby _ this was nearly everything there was in Juana's world.
"""Then we will go to him,"" Juana said, and with one hand she arranged her dark blue shawl over her head and made of one end of it a sling to hold the moaning baby and made of the other end of it a shade over his eyes to protect him from the light."
The people in the door pushed against those behind to let her through.
"They made a quick soft-footed procession into the center of the town, first Juana and Kino, and behind them Juan Tomás and Apolonia, her big stomach jiggling with the strenuous pace, then all the neighbors with the children trotting on the flanks."
And the yellow sun threw their black shadows ahead of them so that they walked on their own shadows.
"They came to the place where the brush houses stopped and the city of stone and plaster began, the city of harsh outer walls and inner cool gardens where a little water played and the bougainvillaea crusted the walls with purple and brick-red and white."
They heard from the secret gardens the singing of caged birds and heard the splash of cooling water on hot flagstones.
"It had grown now, and on the outskirts the hurrying newcomers were being softly informed how the baby had been stung by a scorpion, how the father and mother were taking it to the doctor."
"And the newcomers, particularly the beggars from the front of the church who were great experts in financial analysis, looked quickly at Juana's old blue skirt, saw the tears in her shawl, appraised the green ribbon on her braids, read the age of Kino's blanket and the thousand washings of his clothes, and set them down as poverty people and went along to see what kind of drama might develop."
They slept at their posts in the shadow of the church so that no one crept in for consolation without their knowledge.
They knew his clumsy abortions and the little brown pennies he gave sparingly for alms.
"And, since early Mass was over and business was slow, they followed the procession, these endless searchers after perfect knowledge of their fellow men, to see what the fat lazy doctor would do about an indigent baby with a scorpion bite."
"This doctor was of a race which for nearly four hundred years had beaten and starved and robbed and despised Kino's race, and frightened it too, so that the indigene came humbly to the door."
"He could kill the doctor more easily than he could talk to him, for all of the doctor's race spoke to all of Kino's race as though they were simple animals."
"And as Kino raised his right hand to the iron ring knocker in the gate, rage swelled in him, and the pounding music of the enemy beat in his ears, and his lips drew tight against his teeth _ but with his left hand he reached to take off his hat."
The iron ring pounded against the gate.
"Coyotito moaned a little in Juana's arms, and she spoke softly to him."
The glaring sun threw the bunched shadows of the people blackly on the white wall.
"He had on his dressing gown of red watered silk that had come from Paris, a little tight over the chest now if it was buttoned."
"On his lap was a silver tray with a silver chocolate pot and a tiny cup of eggshell china, so delicate that it looked silly when he lifted it with his big hand, lifted it with the tips of thumb and forefinger and spread the other three fingers wide to get them out of the way."
His eyes rested in puffy little hammocks of flesh and his mouth drooped with discontent.
He poured his second cup of chocolate and crumbled a sweet biscuit in his fingers.
The doctor put his cup down gently before he let his anger rise.
"""Have I nothing better to do than cure insect bites for 'little Indians'?"
"The servant took the paper and closed the gate again, but this time he was not gone long."
And he shut the gate quickly out of shame.
And now a wave of shame went over the whole procession.
"The beggars went back to the church steps, the stragglers moved off, and the neighbors departed so that the public shaming of Kino would not be in their eyes."
"Then, without warning, he struck the gate a crushing blow with his fist."
"And on the beach the white and blue canoes that came from Nayarit were drawn up, canoes preserved for generations by a hard shell-like waterproof plaster whose making was a secret of the fishing people."
"The beach was yellow sand, but at the water's edge a rubble of shell and algae took its place."
"Fiddler crabs bubbled and sputtered in their holes in the sand, and in the shadows little lobsters popped in and out of their tiny homes in the rubble and sand."
The brown algae waved in the gentle currents and the green eel grass swayed and little sea horses clung to its stems.
"Spotted botete, the poison fish, lay on the bottom in the eelgrass beds, and the bright colored swimming crabs scampered over them."
"Although the morning was young, the hazy mirage was up."
"Across the estuary from the town one section of mangroves stood clear and telescopically defined, while another mangrove clump was a hazy black-green blob."
"There was no certainty in seeing, no proof that what you saw was there or was not there."
"A copper haze hung over the water, and the hot morning sun beat on it and made it vibrate blindingly."
"Kino and Juana came slowly down to the beach and to Kino's canoe, which was the one thing of value he owned in the world."
"Kino's grandfather had brought it from Nayarit, and he had given it to Kino's father, and so it had come to Kino."
But the remedy lacked his authority because it was simple and didn't cost anything.
The stomach cramps had not come to Coyotito.
"Perhaps Juana had sucked out the poison in time, but she had not sucked out her worry over her firstborn."
"Then in co-ordination Juana and Kino drove their double-bladed paddles into the sea, and the canoe creased the water and hissed with speed."
The other pearlers were gone out long since.
In a few moments Kino could see them clustered in the haze riding over the oyster bed.
"Light filtered down through the water to the bed where the frilly pearl oysters lay fastened to the rubbly bottom, a bottom strewn with shells of broken, opened oysters."
"This was the bed that had raised the King of Spain to be a great power in Europe in past years, had helped to pay for his wars, and had decorated the churches for his soul's sake."
"The gray oysters with ruffles like skirts on the shells, the barnacle-crusted oysters with little bits of weed clinging to the skirts and small crabs climbing over them."
"An accident could happen to these oysters, a grain of sand could lie in the folds of muscle and irritate the flesh until in self-protection the flesh coated the grain with a layer of smooth cement."
"But once started, the flesh continued to coat the foreign body until it fell free in some tidal flurry or until the oyster was destroyed."
"For centuries men had dived down and torn the oysters from the beds and ripped them open, looking for the coated grains of sand."
Swarms of fish lived near the bed to live near the oysters thrown back by the searching men and to nibble at the shining inner shells.
"But the pearls were accidents, and the finding of one was luck, a little pat on the back by God or the gods or both."
"Above, the surface of the water was an undulating mirror of brightness, and he could see the bottoms of the canoes sticking through it."
"Now, Kino's people had sung of everything that happened or existed."
"They had made songs to the fishes, to the sea in anger and to the sea in calm, to the light and the dark and the sun and the moon, and the songs were all in Kino and in his people _ every song that had ever been made, even the ones forgotten."
"And as he filled his basket the song was in Kino, and the beat of the song was his pounding heart as it ate the oxygen from his held breath, and the melody of the song was the gray-green water and the little scuttling animals and the clouds of fish that flitted by and were gone."
"And in the canoe above him Kino knew that Juana was making the magic of prayer, her face set rigid and her muscles hard to force the luck, to tear the luck out of the gods' hands, for she needed the luck for the swollen shoulder of Coyotito."
"Kino, in his pride and youth and strength, could remain down over two minutes without strain, so that he worked deliberately, selecting the largest shells."
"A little to his right a hummock of rubbly rock stuck up, covered with young oysters not ready to take."
"Kino moved next to the hummock, and then, beside it, under a little overhang, he saw a very large oyster lying by itself, not covered with its clinging brothers."
"The shell was partly open, for the overhang protected this ancient oyster, and in the lip-like muscle Kino saw a ghostly gleam, and then the shell closed down."
His heart beat out a heavy rhythm and the melody of the maybe pearl shrilled in his ears.
"Juana sensed his excitement, and she pretended to look away."
It is not good to want a thing too much.
But Juana stopped breathing.
"What he had seen, he knew, might be a reflection, a piece of flat shell accidentally drifted in or a complete illusion."
In this Gulf of uncertain light there were more illusions than realities.
But Juana's eyes were on him and she could not wait.
She put her hand on Coyotito's covered head.
He worked the blade lever-wise and the closing muscle parted and the shell fell apart.
It captured the light and refined it and gave it back in silver incandescence.
Juana caught her breath and moaned a little.
She lifted the poultice of seaweed and looked at the shoulder.
Then Kino's fist closed over the pearl and his emotion broke over him.
"The men in the other canoes looked up, startled, and then they dug their paddles into the sea and raced toward Kino's canoe."
"A town is a thing separate from all other towns, so that there are no two towns alike."
And a town has a whole emotion.
How news travels through a town is a mystery not easily to be solved.
"News seems to move faster than small boys can scramble and dart to tell it, faster than women can call it over the fences."
"Before Kino and Juana and the other fishers had come to Kino's brush house, the nerves of the town were pulsing and vibrating with the news _ Kino had found the Pearl of the World."
"Before panting little boys could strangle out the words, their mothers knew it."
"The news swept on past the brush houses, and it washed in a foaming wave into the town of stone and plaster."
"It came to the priest walking in his garden, and it put a thoughtful look in his eyes and a memory of certain repairs necessary to the church."
"And he wondered whether he had baptized Kino's baby, or married him for that matter."
"""I am treating his child for a scorpion sting."""
"He remembered the room he had lived in there as a great and luxurious place, and he remembered the hard-faced woman who had lived with him as a beautiful and kind girl, although she had been none of these three."
The doctor looked past his aged patient and saw himself sitting in a restaurant in Paris and a waiter was just opening a bottle of wine.
"But there was a price below which they dared not go, for it had happened that a fisherman in despair had given his pearls to the church."
"And when the buying was over, these buyers sat alone and their fingers played restlessly with the pearls, and they wished they owned the pearls."
"For there were not many buyers really _ there was only one, and he kept these agents in separate offices to give a semblance of competition."
"The news came to these men, and their eyes squinted and their fingertips burned a little, and each one thought how the patron could not live forever and someone had to take his place."
And each one thought how with some capital he could get a new start.
All manner of people grew interested in Kino _ people with things to sell and people with favors to ask.
"Every man suddenly became related to Kino's pearl, and Kino's pearl went into the dreams, the speculations; the schemes, the plans, the futures, the wishes, the needs, the lusts, the hungers, of everyone, and only one person stood in the way and that was Kino, so that he became curiously every man's enemy."
But Kino and Juana did not know these things.
"In the afternoon, when the sun had gone over the mountains of the Peninsula to sink in the outward sea, Kino squatted in his house with Juana beside him."
And the brush house was crowded with neighbors.
And the music of the pearl had merged with the music of the family so that one beautified the other.
The neighbors looked at the pearl in Kino's hand and they wondered how such luck could come to any man.
"And Juan Tomás, who squatted on Kino's right hand because he was his brother, asked, ""What will you do now that you have become a rich man?"""
"Kino looked into his pearl, and Juana cast her eyelashes down and arranged her shawl to cover her face so that her excitement could not be seen."
"In the pearl he saw Juana and Coyotito and himself standing and kneeling at the high altar, and they were being married now that they could pay."
"He spoke softly, ""We will be married _ in the church."""
"He himself was dressed in new white clothes, and he carried a new hat _ not of straw but of fine black felt _ and he too wore shoes _ not sandals but shoes that laced."
But Coyotito _ he was the one _ he wore a blue sailor suit from the United States and a little yachting cap such as Kino had seen once when a pleasure boat put into the estuary.
And the music of the pearl rose like a chorus of trumpets in his ears.
"Then to the lovely gray surface of the pearl came the little things Kino wanted: a harpoon to take the place of one lost a year ago, a new harpoon of iron with a ring in the end of the shaft; and _ his mind could hardly make the leap _ a rifle _ but why not, since he was so rich."
"His lips moved hesitantly over this _ ""A rifle,"" he said."
"This was an impossibility, and if he could think of having a rifle whole horizons were burst and he could rush on."
"And a man in the rear murmured, ""A rifle."
But the music of the pearl was shrilling with triumph in Kino.
"And Coyotito was dressed in a jacket, and he had on a white collar and a broad silken tie."
"Moreover, Coyotito was writing on a big piece of paper."
"Her eyes were bright as she watched him, and she looked quickly down at Coyotito in her arms to see whether this might be possible."
But Kino's face shone with prophecy.
And in the pearl Kino saw himself and Juana squatting by the little fire in the brush hut while Coyotito read from a great book.
And suddenly he was afraid of his talking.
"They knew that time would now date from Kino's pearl, and that they would discuss this moment for many years to come."
"And if Kino's planning came to nothing, those same neighbors would say, ""There it started."
God keep us from such things.
"And Juana looped her shawl under the baby so that he hung against her hip, and she went to the fire hole and dug a coal from the ashes and broke a few twigs over it and fanned a flame alive."
"The dark was almost in, and Juana's fire threw shadows on the brush walls when the whisper came in, passed from mouth to mouth."
"Kino and Juan Tomás, his brother, stood up."
"The priest came in _ a graying, aging man with an old skin and a young sharp eye."
"Kino looked quickly down at Coyotito's head, where he hung on Juana's hip."
"The music had gone out of Kino's head, but now, thinly, slowly, the melody of the morning, the music of evil, of the enemy sounded, but it was faint and weak."
But the priest was speaking again.
"""It has come to me that thou hast found a great fortune, a great pearl."""
"And then he said, ""I hope thou wilt remember to give thanks, my son, to Him who has given thee this treasure, and to pray for guidance in the future."""
"But Kino's hand had closed tightly on the pearl again, and he was glancing about suspiciously, for the evil song was in his ears, shrilling against the music of the pearl."
"As always, he could smell the smoke from many fires, and he could see the hazy stars and feel the damp of the night air so that he covered his nose from it."
"The thin dog came to him and threshed itself in greeting like a windblown flag, and Kino looked down at it and didn't see it."
Behind him he heard Juana patting the cakes before she put them down on the clay cooking sheet.
"Kino felt all the warmth and security of his family behind him, and the Song of the Family came from behind him like the purring of a kitten."
A plan once made and visualized becomes a reality along with other realities _ never to be destroyed but easily to be attacked.
"Thus Kino's future was real, but having set it up, other forces were set up to destroy it, and this he knew, so that he had to prepare to meet the attack."
His eyes and his mind probed for danger before it appeared.
"Standing in the door, he saw two men approach; and one of them carried a lantern which lighted the ground and the legs of the men."
They turned in through the opening of Kino's brush fence and came to his door.
The split knuckles on Kino's right hand burned when he saw who they were.
"Kino stood in the door, filling it, and hatred raged and flamed in back of his eyes, and fear too, for the hundreds of years of subjugation were cut deep in him."
"He pursed his lips and made a little explosion to show how quick it could be, and he shifted his small black doctor's bag about so that the light of the lamp fell upon it, for he knew that Kino's race love the tools of any craft and trust them."
And he could not take the chance of pitting his certain ignorance against this man's possible knowledge.
"He was trapped as his people were always trapped, and would be until, as he had said, they could be sure that the things in the books were really in the books."
He could not take a chance _ not with the life or with the straightness of Coyotito.
He stood aside and let the doctor and his man enter the brush hut.
"Juana stood up from the fire and backed away as he entered, and she covered the baby's face with the fringe of her shawl."
He held the eyelid down.
Then from his bag he took a little bottle of white powder and a capsule of gelatine.
He took the baby and pinched its lower lip until it opened its mouth.
"His fat fingers placed the capsule far back on the baby's tongue, back of the point where he could spit it out, and then from the floor he picked up the little pitcher of pulque and gave Coyotito a drink, and it was done."
Perhaps I am in time to save him.
"He moved his hand to look under the eyelid, and only then saw that the pearl was still in his hand."
"Then he went to a box by the wall, and from it he brought a piece of rag."
"The doctor, back in his house, settled into his chair and looked at his watch."
"His people brought him a little supper of chocolate and sweet cakes and fruit, and he stared at the food discontentedly."
"From now on they would watch Kino and Juana very closely to see whether riches turned their heads, as riches turn all people's heads."
Out in the estuary a tight woven school of small fishes glittered and broke water to escape a school of great fishes that drove in to eat them.
The skinny black puppy with flame spots over his eyes came to Kino's door and looked in.
"He nearly shook his hint quarters loose when Kino glanced up at him, and he subsided when Kino looked away."
"The puppy did not enter the house, but he watched with frantic interest while Kino ate his beans from the little pottery dish and wiped it clean with a corncake and ate the cake and washed the whole down with a drink of pulque."
"Kino was finished and was rolling a cigarette when Juana spoke sharply, ""Kino."""
"He kicked a pile of twigs into the fire hole to make a blaze, and then he could see the face of Coyotito."
The baby's face was flushed and his throat was working and a little thick drool of saliva issued from his lips.
"Now uncertainty was in Kino, and the music of evil throbbed in his head and nearly drove out Juana's song."
"He brushed his fingers on a napkin, looked at his watch, arose, and took up his little bag."
"The news of the baby's illness traveled quickly along the brush houses, for sickness is second only to hunger as the enemy of poor people."
And they nodded and got up to go to Kino's house.
The neighbors scuttled with covered noses through the dark until they crowded into Kino's house again.
"They stood and gazed, and they made little comments on the sadness that this should happen at a time of joy, and they said, ""All things are in God's hands."""
The old women squatted down beside Juana to try to give her aid if they could and comfort if they could not.
"He asked for water, and in the cup of it he put three drops of ammonia, and he pried open the baby's mouth and poured it down."
"The baby spluttered and screeched under the treatment, and Juana watched him with haunted eyes."
"But Kino was suspicious, and he could not take his eyes from the doctor's open bag, and from the bottle of white powder there."
"And then Coyotito sighed deeply and went to sleep, for he was very tired with vomiting."
The doctor put the baby in Juana's arms.
"He has found the Pearl of the World,"" they cried, and they joined forefinger with thumb to show how great the pearl was."
"""Kino will be a rich man,"" they clamored."
"Kino's eyes were hooded now, his cheeks were drawn taut."
"The doctor shrugged, and his wet eyes never left Kino's eyes."
"He knew the pearl would be buried in the house, and he thought Kino might look toward the place where it was buried."
"""It would be a shame to have it stolen before you could sell it,"" the doctor said, and he saw Kino's eyes flick involuntarily to the floor near the side post of the brush house."
"When the doctor had gone and all the neighbors had reluctantly returned to their houses, Kino squatted beside the little glowing coals in the fire hole and listened to the night sound, the soft sweep of the little waves on the shore and the distant barking of dogs, the creeping of the breeze through the brush house roof and the soft speech of his neighbors in their houses in the village."
"After he had probed the night with his senses he went to the place by the side post where the pearl was buried, and he dug it up and brought it to his sleeping mat, and under his sleeping mat he dug another little hole in the dirt floor and buried the pearl and covered it up again."
"And Juana, sitting by the fire hole, watched him with questioning eyes, and when he had buried his pearl she asked, ""Who do you fear?"""
"Kino searched for a true answer, and at last he said, ""Everyone."""
And he could feel a shell of hardness drawing over him.
"But Kino's brain burned, even during his sleep, and he dreamed that Coyotito could read, that one of his own people could tell him the truth of things."
"And then darkness spread over the page, and with the darkness came the music of evil again, and Kino stirred in his sleep; and when he stirred, Juana's eyes opened in the darkness."
"But Juana's hand came creeping over to him in warning, and then the sound came again! the whisper of a foot on dry earth and the scratch of fingers in the soil."
"And now a wild fear surged in Kino's breast, and on the fear came rage, as it always did."
"Kino's hand crept into his breast where his knife hung on a string, and then he sprang like an angry cat, leaped striking and spitting for the dark thing he knew was in the corner of the house."
"He felt cloth, struck at it with his knife and missed, and struck again and felt his knife go through cloth, and then his head crashed with lightning and exploded with pain."
She uncovered an ember from the ashes and shredded little pieces of cornhusk over it and blew a little flame into the cornhusks so that a tiny light danced through the hut.
"She worked quickly, crooning as she moved about."
She dipped the end of her head shawl in water and swabbed the blood from Kino's bruised forehead.
"But Kino's face was set, and his mind and his will were set."
"His dark eyes scowled into the little fire, and for the first time he knew that his knife was still in his hands, and he raised the blade and looked at it and saw a little line of blood on the steel."
"The wind of the morning ruffled the water of the estuary and whispered through the mangroves, and the little waves beat on the rubbly beach with an increased tempo."
"And the beauty of the pearl, winking and glimmering in the light of the little candle, cozened his brain with its beauty."
"So lovely it was, so soft, and its own music came from it _ its music of promise and delight, its guarantee of the future, of comfort, of security."
And as he stared at it Kino's eyes softened and his face relaxed.
"Juana, glancing secretly at him, saw him smile."
It is wonderful the way a little town keeps track of itself and of all its units.
"If every single man and woman, child and baby, acts and conducts itself in a known pattern and breaks no walls and differs with no one and experiments in no way and is not sick and does not endanger the ease and peace of mind or steady unbroken flow of the town, then that unit can disappear and never be heard of."
"But let one man step out of the regular thought or the known and trusted pattern, and the nerves of the townspeople ring with nervousness and communication travels over the nerve lines of the town."
"It was known among the neighbors in the brush huts, among the pearl fishermen; it was known among the Chinese grocery-store owners; it was known in the church, for the altar boys whispered about it."
"Word of it crept in among the nuns; the beggars in front of the church spoke of it, for they would be there to take the tithe of the first fruits of the luck."
"The little boys knew about it with excitement, but most of all the pearl buyers knew about it, and when the day had come, in the offices of the pearl buyers, each man sat alone with his little black velvet tray, and each man rolled the pearls about with his fingertips and considered his part in the picture."
"But this was a wasteful method, for often, in the excitement of bidding for a fine pearl, too great a price had been paid to the fishermen."
"Now there was only one pearl buyer with many hands, and the men who sat in their offices and waited for Kino knew what price they would offer, how high they would bid, and what method each one would use."
"Quite apart from any reward they might get, from any word of praise, from any promotion, a pearl buyer was a pearl buyer, and the best and happiest pearl buyer was he who bought for the lowest prices."
"The sun was hot yellow that morning, and it drew the moisture from the estuary and from the Gulf and hung it in shimmering scarves in the air so that the air vibrated and vision was insubstantial."
"A vision hung in the air to the north of the city _ the vision of a mountain that was over two hundred miles away, and the high slopes of this mountain were swaddled with pines and a great stone peak arose above the timber line."
"And the morning of this day the canoes lay lined up on the beach; the fishermen did not go out to dive for pearls, for there would be too much happening, too many things to see when Kino went to sell the great pearl."
"In the brush houses by the shore Kino's neighbors sat long over their breakfasts, and they spoke of what they would do if they had found the pearl."
"Another thought he might take the money and distribute it among the poor of La Paz; and a fourth thought of all the good things one could do with the money from the pearl, of all the charities, benefits, of all the rescues one could perform if one had money."
"For Kino and Juana this was the morning of mornings of their lives, comparable only to the day when the baby had been born."
"Thus they would say, ""It was two years before we sold the pearl,"" or, ""It was six weeks after we sold the pearl."""
"Juana, considering the matter, threw caution to the winds, and she dressed Coyotito in the clothes she had prepared for his baptism, when there would be money for his baptism."
"And Juana combed and braided her hair and tied the ends with two little bows of red ribbon, and she put on her marriage skirt and waist."
"Kino's ragged white clothes were clean at least, and this was the last day of his raggedness."
"For tomorrow, or even this afternoon, he would have new clothes."
"The neighbors, watching Kino's door through the crevices in their brush houses, were dressed and ready too."
There was no self-consciousness about their joining Kino and Juana to go pearl selling.
It would be almost a sign of unfriendship.
"Juana put on her head shawl carefully, and she draped one long end under her right elbow and gathered it with her right hand so that a hammock hung under her arm, and in this little hammock she placed Coyotito, propped up against the head shawl so that he could see everything and perhaps remember."
"Kino put on his large straw hat and felt it with his hand to see that it was properly placed, not on the back or side of his head, like a rash, unmarried, irresponsible man, and not flat as an elder would wear it, but tilted a little forward to show aggressiveness and seriousness and vigor."
"The great pearl was wrapped in an old soft piece of deerskin and placed in a little leather bag, and the leather bag was in a pocket in Kino's shirt."
"But be cause of the seriousness of the occasion, only one man walked with Kino, and that was his brother, Juan Tomás."
"""You must be careful to see they do not cheat you,"" he said."
"""How can we know what is a fair price, if we do not know what the pearl buyer gets for the pearl in another place."""
"""Before you were born, Kino,"" he said, ""the old ones thought of a way to get more money for their pearls."
"""And so they got such a man,"" said Juan Tomás, ""and they pooled their pearls, and they started him off."
"The brothers, as they walked along, squinted their eyes a little, as they and their grandfathers and their great-grandfathers had done for four hundred years, since first the strangers came with argument and authority and gunpowder to back up both."
And in the four hundred years Kino's people had learned only one defense _ a slight slitting of the eyes and a slight tightening of the lips and a retirement.
"The gathering procession was solemn, for they sensed the importance of this day, and any children who showed a tendency to scuffle, to scream, to cry out, to steal hats and rumple hair, were hissed to silence by elders."
The procession left the brush huts and entered the stone and plaster city where the streets were a little wider and there were narrow pavements beside the buildings.
"The news of the approach of the procession ran ahead of it, and in their little dark offices the pearl buyers stiffened and grew alert."
"They got out papers so that they could be at work when Kino appeared, and they put their pearls in the desks, for it is not good to let an inferior pearl be seen beside a beauty."
And word of the loveliness of Kino's pearl had come to them.
"The pearl buyers' offices were clustered together in one narrow street, and they were barred at the windows, and wooden slats cut out the light so that only a soft gloom entered the offices."
"He was a caller of good mornings, a ceremonious shaker of hands, a jolly man who knew all jokes and yet who hovered close to sadness, for in the midst of a laugh he could remember the death of your aunt, and his eyes could become wet with sorrow for your loss."
"This morning he had placed a flower in a vase on his desk, a single scarlet hibiscus, and the vase sat beside the black velvet-lined pearl tray in front of him."
"He rolled a coin back and forth over his knuckles and made it appear and disappear, made it spin and sparkle."
"Then he heard the tramp of feet of the approaching crowd, and the fingers of his right hand worked faster and faster until, as the figure of Kino filled the doorway, the coin flashed and disappeared."
"Kino stared into the dimness of the little office, for his eyes were squeezed from the outside glare."
And Juan Tomás stood beside him and snorted a little at the understatement.
"The neighbors peered around the doorway, and a line of little boys clambered on the window bars and looked through."
"Several little boys, on their hands and knees, watched the scene around Kino's legs."
Now Kino instinctively knew his own dramatic effects.
"Slowly he brought out the leather bag, slowly took from it the soft and dirty piece of deerskin, and then he let the great pearl roll into the black velvet tray, and instantly his eyes went to the buyer's face."
"But there was no sign, no movement, the face did not change, but the secret hand behind the desk missed in its precision."
"When the right hand came out of hiding, the forefinger touched the great pearl, rolled it on the black velvet; thumb and forefinger picked it up and brought it near to the dealer's eyes and twirled it in the air."
"""He is inspecting it _ No price has been mentioned yet _ They have not come to a price."""
"The hand tossed the great pearl back in the tray, the forefinger poked and insulted it, and on the dealer's face there came a sad and contemptuous smile."
"""It is a pearl of great value,"" Kino said."
The dealer's fingers spurned the pearl so that it bounced and rebounded softly from the side of the velvet tray.
"You thought it was a thing of value, and it is only a curiosity."""
Now Kino's face was perplexed and worried.
As a curiosity it has interest; some museum might perhaps take it to place in a collection of seashells.
Kino's face grew dark and dangerous.
And the dealer felt a little tremor of fear.
"""Do not blame me,"" he said quickly."
Kino's neighbors whispered together.
They had been suspicious of it from the first.
"And after all, a thousand pesos was not to be thrown away."
Only yesterday he had nothing.
The crowd in the doorway wavered and broke and let the three pearl dealers through.
"He felt a little tugging at his back, and he turned and looked in Juana's eyes, and when he looked away he had renewed strength."
"The man behind the desk said, ""I have put a value on this pearl."
"""Better pearls are made of paste,"" he said."
The third dealer took the pearl from Kino's hands.
He wrapped it in the deerskin and thrust it inside his shirt.
"The man behind the desk said, ""I'm a fool, I know, but my first offer stands."
"They knew they had played too hard; they knew they would be disciplined for their failure, and the man at the desk said quickly, ""I might go to fifteen hundred."""
"When the evening came, the neighbors in the brush houses sat eating their corncakes and beans, and they discussed the great theme of the morning."
"They did not know, it seemed a fine pearl to them, but they had never seen such a pearl before, and surely the dealers knew more about the value of pearls than they."
"""But suppose they had arranged it before?"""
"That is a great deal of money, more than he has ever seen."
Suppose he should really go to the capital and find no buyer for his pearl.
"In his house Kino squatted on his sleeping mat, brooding."
"It lay over the water and through the mountains, over a thousand miles, and every strange terrible mile was frightening."
"For his dream of the future was real and never to be destroyed, and he had said ""I will go,"" and that made a real thing too."
"Juana watched him while he buried his pearl, and she watched him while she cleaned Coyotito and nursed him, and Juana made the corncakes for supper."
"Juan Tomás came in and squatted down beside Kino and remained silent for a long time, until at last Kino demanded, ""What else could I do?"
"You have defied not the pearl buyers, but the whole structure, the whole way of life, and I am afraid for you."""
Long after Juan Tomás had gone Kino sat brooding on his sleeping mat.
The little flare of the twig fire made the design on his sleeping mat jump before his entranced eyes.
"Juana watched him with worry, but she knew him and she knew she could help him best by being silent and by being near."
"And as though she too could hear the Song of Evil, she fought it, singing softly the melody of the family, of the safety and warmth and wholeness of the family."
"His eyes were entranced, and he could sense the wary, watchful evil outside the brush house; he could feel the dark creeping things waiting for him to go out into the night."
"She seized a stone from the fireplace and rushed outside, but it was over by then."
"Kino lay on the ground, struggling to rise, and there was no one near him."
Only the shadows and the strike and rush of waves and the hiss of distance.
"She brought him pulque to drink in a little pitcher, and still he shook his head to clear out the darkness."
Let us destroy it before it destroys us.
Let us _ let us throw it back in the sea where it belongs.
And as she spoke the light came back in Kino's eyes so that they glowed fiercely and his muscles hardened and his will hardened.
We will have our chance.
His eyes softened then and he raised a gentle hand to Juana's shoulder.
You are not afraid to go with me?
The late moon arose before the first rooster crowed.
"Quietly he tracked her, and his brain was red with anger."
"Juana, in her woman's soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it."
"Although she might be puzzled by these differences between man and woman, she knew them and accepted them and needed them."
"Sometimes the quality of woman, the reason, the caution, the sense of preservation, could cut through Kino's manness and save them all."
"She climbed painfully to her feet, and she dipped her cupped palms in the little waves and washed her bruised face with the stinging salt water, and then she went creeping up the beach after Kino."
A flight of herring clouds had moved over the sky from the south.
The pale moon dipped in and out of the strands of clouds so that Juana walked in darkness for a moment and in light the next.
"She sank to her knees and picked it up, and the moon went into the darkness of the clouds again."
"Juana remained on her knees while she considered whether to go back to the sea and finish her job, and as she considered, the light came again, and she saw two dark figures lying in the path ahead of her."
"Now, in an instant, Juana knew that the old life was gone forever."
"A dead man in the path and Kino's knife, dark bladed beside him, convinced her."
"All of the time Juana had been trying to rescue something of the old peace, of the time before the pearl."
"But now it was gone, and there was no retrieving it."
We must be gone before the daylight comes.
"""Do you remember yesterday?"" Juana asked."
And his will hardened and he was a man again.
And when the light broke trough again he saw that a great hole had been knocked in the bottom.
"There was sorrow in Kino's rage, but this last thing had tightened him beyond breaking."
"He leaped up the beach, through the brush line toward his brush house, and it did not occur to him to take one of the canoes of his neighbors."
"Kino, hurrying toward his house, felt a surge of exhilaration."
"Now he was not confused, for there was only one thing to do, and Kino's hand went first to the great pearl in his shirt and then to his knife hanging under his shirt."
"He saw a little glow ahead of him, and then without interval a tall flame leaped up in the dark with a crackling roar, and a tall edifice of fire lighted the pathway."
And he knew that these houses could burn down in a very few moments.
"And as he ran a scuttling figure ran toward him _ Juana, with Coyotito in her arms and Kino's shoulder blanket clutched in her hand."
"The baby moaned with fright, and Juana's eyes were wide and terrified."
The fierce light of the burning house lighted Kino's face strongly.
Suddenly Kino was afraid.
"For a moment he considered and then he worked among the shadows until he came to the house of Juan Tomás, his brother, and he slipped into the doorway and drew Juana after him."
"The house of Juan Tomás was almost exactly like Kino's house; nearly all the brush houses were alike, and all leaked light and air, so that Juana and Kino, sitting in the corner of the brother's house, could see the leaping flames through the wall."
"They saw the flames tall and furious, they saw the roof fall and watched the fire die down as quickly as a twig fire dies."
"They heard the cries of warning of their friends, and the shrill, keening cry of Apolonia, wife of Juan Tomás."
Apolonia realized that she was wearing her secondbest head shawl and she rushed to her house to get her fine new one.
"As she rummaged in a box by the wall, Kino's voice said quietly, ""Apolonia, do not cry out."
"""Who?"" asked Juan Tomás quickly."
"And Kino, looking closely, saw deep worry come into his brother's eyes and he forestalled him in a possible refusal."
"""Not for long,"" he said quickly."
"Crouching in the house of Juan Tomás, they heard the shock go into their neighbors' minds at the news of the broken boat."
"And in that day the wind rose up to beat the Gulf and tore the kelps and weeds that lined the shore, and the wind cried through the brush houses and no boat was safe on the water."
And after each trip among the neighbors Juan Tomás came back with something borrowed.
He brought a little woven straw bag of red beans and a gourd full of rice.
"He borrowed a cup of dried peppers and a block of salt, and he brought in a long working knife, eighteen inches long and heavy, as a small ax, a tool and a weapon."
"The wind screamed over the Gulf and turned the water white, and the mangroves plunged like frightened cattle, and a fine sandy dust arose from the land and hung in a stifling cloud over the sea."
"Then Juan Tomás, when the evening approached, talked long with his brother."
They left quietly in the dark before the moon had risen.
The family stood formally in the house of Juán Tomás.
"The head shawl covered the baby, and one end of it came across Juana's nose to protect her from the evil night air."
"Kino threaded his way around the edge of the city and turned north, north by the stars, and found the rutted sandy road that led through the brushy country toward Loreto where the miraculous Virgin has her station."
And Kino could hear the pad of Juana's feet behind him.
Some ancient thing stirred in Kino.
"Through his fear of dark and the devils that haunt the night, there came a rush of exhilaration; some animal thing was moving in him so that he was cautious and wary and dangerous; some ancient thing out of the past of his people was alive in him."
"Now they could see the little road ahead of them, deep cut with sand-drifted wheel tracks."
"The music of the pearl was triumphant in Kino's head, and the quiet melody of the family underlay it, and they wove themselves into the soft padding of sandaled feet in the dust."
"He found his place near to the road, a little clearing where deer might have lain, and it was curtained thickly with the dry brittle trees that lined the road."
"And then, in the first light, he heard the creak of a wagon, and he crouched beside the road and watched a heavy two-wheeled cart go by, drawn by slouching oxen."
"She gave him the soft corncakes Apolonia had packed for them, and after a while she slept a little."
"He watched the ants moving, a little column of them near to his foot, and he put his foot in their path."
"""Beware of that kind of tree there,"" he said, pointing."
"See, that one over there."
"And he said quickly, ""We will be married in a great church."""
"And there in the pearl Coyotito's face, thick and feverish from the medicine."
"And then he moaned and sat up suddenly, his eyes wide and his nostrils flaring."
He listened and heard only the cricking heat and the hiss of distance.
"But he was restless, and when she gave him a corncake from her store he paused in his chewing to listen."
"He stood up then, silently; and crouched low, he threaded his way through the brush toward the road."
"But he knew what they were, and a chill of fear went through him."
"Even in the distance he could see the two on foot moving slowly along, bent low to the ground."
"Here, one would pause and look at the earth, while the other joined him."
"Here, he and Juana might have stepped out of the wheel rut, and these people from the inland, these hunters, could follow, could read a broken straw or a little tumbled pile of dust."
Kino slowly drew his big knife to his hand and made it ready.
That was his only chance in the world.
"And as the three drew nearer on the road, Kino dug little pits with his sandaled toes so that he could leap without warning, so that his feet would not slip."
"Kino was not breathing, but his back arched a little and the muscles of his arms and legs stood out with tension and a line of sweat formed on his upper lip."
"The trackers scuttled along, stopping, looking, and hurrying on."
He slid backward and did not bother to cover his tracks.
"There was no escape, except in flight."
Instantly Juana was on her feet and her hand lay on his arm.
"Kino did not try to conceal his passage as he trotted, kicking the stones, knocking the telltale leaves from the little trees."
The high sun streamed down on the dry creaking earth so that even the vegetation ticked in protest.
"But ahead were the naked granite mountains, rising out of erosion rubble and standing monolithic against the sky."
"This land was waterless, furred with the cacti which could store water and with the great-rooted brush which could reach deep into the earth for a little moisture and get along on very little."
"And underfoot was not soil but broken rock, split into small cubes, great slabs, but none of it water-rounded."
"Little tufts of sad dry grass grew between the stones, grass that had sprouted with one single rain and headed, dropped its seed, and died."
Horned toads watched the family go by and turned their little pivoting dragon heads.
"And now and then a great jackrabbit, disturbed in his shade, bumped away and hid behind the nearest rock."
"The singing heat lay over this desert country, and ahead the stone mountains looked cool and welcoming."
"A little way along the road the trackers would become aware that they had missed the path, and they would come back, searching and judging, and in a little while they would find the place where Kino and Juana had rested."
"Kino could see them in his mind, slipping along the track, whining a little with eagerness, and behind them, dark and half disinterested, the horseman with the rifle."
"His work would come last, for he would not take them back."
"Oh, the music of evil sang loud in Kino's head now, it sang with the whine of heat and with the dry ringing of snake rattles."
She raised her bottle of water to Coyotito's lips; his little dried tongue sucked greedily at it.
"Now there were long outcroppings of granite with deep crevices between, and Kino walked on bare unmarkable stone when he could and leaped from ledge to ledge."
He knew that wherever the trackers lost his path they must circle and lose time before they found it again.
"And the path rose steeply now, so that he panted a little as he went."
"The sun moved downward toward the bare stone teeth of the mountains, and Kino set his direction for a dark and shadowy cleft in the range."
"If there were any water at all, it would be there where he could see, even in the distance, a hint of foliage."
"And if there were any passage through the smooth stone range, it would be by this same deep cleft."
"High in the gray stone mountains, under a frowning peak, a little spring bubbled out of a rupture in the stone."
"It was fed by shade-preserved snow in the summer, and now and then it died completely and bare rocks and dry algae were on its bottom."
"In the times when the quick rains fell, it might become a freshet and send its column of white water crashing down the mountain cleft, but nearly always it was a lean little spring."
"It bubbled out into a pool and then fell a hundred feet to another pool, and this one, overflowing, dropped again, so that it continued, down and down, until it came to the rubble of the upland, and there it disappeared altogether."
"There wasn't much left of it then anyway, for every time it fell over an escarpment the thirsty air drank it, and it splashed from the pools to the dry vegetation."
"The animals from miles around came to drink from the little pools, and the wild sheep and the deer, the pumas and raccoons, and the mice _ all came to drink."
"Beside this tiny stream, wherever enough earth collected for root-hold, colonies of plants grew, wild grape and little palms, maidenhair fern, hibiscus, and tall pampas grass with feathery rods raised above the spike leaves."
"And in the pool lived frogs and waterskaters, and waterworms crawled on the bottom of the pool."
"The little pools were places of life because of the water, and places of killing because of the water, too."
"The lowest step, where the stream collected before it tumbled down a hundred feet and disappeared into the rubbly desert, was a little platform of stone and sand."
"Only a pencil of water fell into the pool, full and to keep the ferns green in the underhang of the cliff, and wild grape climbed the stone mountain and all manner of little plants found comfort here."
"The freshets had made a small sandy beach through which the pool flowed, and bright green watercress grew in the damp sand."
The sun had passed over the stone mountains when Kino and Juana struggled up the steep broken slope and came at last to the water.
"They came utterly weary to the pool, and Juana slumped to her knees and first washed Coyotito's face and then filled her bottle and gave him a drink."
"For a moment, then, he stretched out beside the water and relaxed all his muscles and watched Juana feeding the baby, and then he got to his feet and went to the edge of the step where the water slipped over, and he searched the distance carefully."
And thirty feet up on the gray shoulder he saw a series of little erosion caves.
"They were only a few feet deep, wind-hollowed scoops, but they sloped slightly downward and back."
"Instead, he climbed up the brush cliff beside the water, clawing and tearing at the ferns and wild grape as he went."
"And when he had climbed a hundred feet to the next bench, he came down again."
"He looked carefully at the smooth rock shoulder toward the cave to see that there was no trace of passage, and last he climbed up and crept into the cave beside Juana."
I am afraid only that the baby may cry.
You must see that he does not cry.
"Now Kino lay in the cave entrance, his chin braced on his crossed arms, and he watched the blue shadow of the mountain move out across the brushy desert below until it reached the Gulf, and the long twilight of the shadow was over the land."
"The two trackers scurried about on the little beach, and they saw Kino's progress up the cliff before they drank."
"And then the match died, but it left a picture on Kino's eyes."
Juana's eyes were two sparks reflecting a low star.
Her hand crept out from under her shawl and gripped his arm.
"""And I must go before moonrise."""
He peered closely at her and he could see her large eyes.
"His hand fumbled out and found the baby, and for a moment his palm lay on Coyotito's head."
"And then Kino raised his hand and touched Juana's cheek, and she held her breath."
"And then she saw how he hooked his amulet neckstring about the horn handle of his great knife, so that it hung down in front of him and left both hands free."
"She could feel his warm breath against her skin, and Juana whispered her combination of prayer and magic, her Hail Marys and her ancient intercession, against the black unhuman things."
He had turned his neckstring so that the great knife hung down from his back and could not clash against the stone.
"His spread fingers gripped the mountain, and his bare toes found support through contact, and even his chest lay against the stone so that he would not slip."
"And Kino's own music was in his head, the music of the enemy, low and pulsing, nearly asleep."
"Kino's mouth was open so that even his breath would make no sound, for he knew that he was not invisible."
He crouched and took great slow long breaths to calm himself
He kneaded his legs against cramp and found that his muscles were jerking after their long tension.
"The moon would rise in a few moments now, and he must attack before it rose."
Silently he drew the amulet string over his shoulder and loosened the loop from the horn handle of his great knife.
"He was too late, for as he rose from his crouch the silver edge of the moon slipped above the eastern horizon, and Kino sank back behind his bush."
And then from above came a little murmuring cry.
"""It sounded like a cry, almost like a human _ like a baby."""
Some coyote bitch with a litter.
I've heard a coyote pup cry like a baby.
"The third man scrabbled away like a crab, slipped into the pool, and then he began to climb frantically, to climb up the cliff where the water penciled down."
"He saw his enemy tumble backward into the pool, and Kino strode to the water."
And then Kino stood uncertainly.
"And then Kino's brain cleared from its red concentration and he knew the sound _ the keening, moaning, rising hysterical cry from the little cave in the side of the stone mountain, the cry of death."
It was late in the golden afternoon when the first little boys ran hysterically in the town and spread the word that Kino and Juana were coming back.
"The two came from the rutted country road into the city, and they were not walking in single file, Kino ahead and Juana behind, as usual, but side by side."
"The sun was behind them and their long shadows stalked ahead, and they seemed to carry two towers of darkness with them."
"The shawl was crusted with dried blood, and the bundle swayed a little as she walked."
And her wide eyes stared inward on herself.
"Kino's lips were thin and his jaws tight, and the people say that he carried fear with him, that he was as dangerous as a rising storm."
The people say that the two seemed to be removed from human experience; that they had gone through pain and had come out on the other side; that there was almost a magical protection about them.
And those people who had rushed to see them crowded back and let them pass and did not speak to them.
"Their legs moved a little jerkily, like well-made wooden dolls, and they carried pillars of black fear about them."
And as they walked through the stone and plaster city brokers peered al them from barred windows and servants put one eye to a slitted gate and mothers turned the faces of their youngest children inward against their skirts.
"Kino and Juana strode side by side through the stone and plaster city and down among the brush houses, and the neighbors stood back and let them pass."
In Kino's ears the Song of the Family was as fierce as a cry.
"He was immune and terrible, and his song had become a battle cry."
And they did not look toward Kino's broken canoe.
"A crab scampering over the bottom raised a little cloud of sand, and when it settled the pearl was gone."
"To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled the expedition were bound to take place, and the wonder to which he had looked forward, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch."
"Since he belonged, even at the age of six, to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that, but must let future prospects, with their joys and sorrows, cloud what is actually at hand, since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallize and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests, James Ramsay, sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy Stores, endowed the picture of a refrigerator as his mother spoke with heavenly bliss."
It was fringed with joy.
"The wheelbarrow, the lawn-mower, the sound of poplar trees, leaves whitening before rain, rooks cawing, brooms knocking, dresses rustling _ all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code, his secret language, though he appeared the image of stark and uncompromising severity, with his high forehead and his fierce blue eyes, impeccably candid and pure, frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty, so that his mother, watching him guide his scissors neatly round the refrigerator, imagined him all red and ermine on the Bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis of public affairs."
"Such were the extremes of emotion that Mr Ramsay excited in his children's breasts by his mere presence; standing, as now, lean as a knife, narrow as the blade of one, grinning sarcastically, not only with the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife, who was ten thousand times better in every way than he was (James thought), but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement."
"He was incapable of untruth; never tampered with a fact; never altered a disagreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being, least of all of his own children, who, sprung from his loins, should be aware from childhood that life is difficult; facts uncompromising; and the passage to that fabled land where our brightest hopes are extinguished, our frail barks founder in darkness (here Mr Ramsay would straighten his back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon), one that needs, above all, courage, truth, and the power to endure."
"If she finished it tonight, if they did go to the Lighthouse after all, it was to be given to the Lighthouse keeper for his little boy, who was threatened with a tuberculous hip; together with a pile of old magazines, and some tobacco, indeed whatever she could find lying about, not really wanted, but only littering the room, to give those poor fellows who must be bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden, something to amuse them."
"For how would you like to be shut up for a whole month at a time, and possibly more in stormy weather, upon a rock the size of a tennis lawn? she would ask; and to have no letters or newspapers, and to see nobody; if you were married, not to see your wife, not to know how your children were, _ if they were ill, if they had fallen down and broken their legs or arms; to see the same dreary waves breaking week after week, and then a dreadful storm coming, and the windows covered with spray, and birds dashed against the lamp, and the whole place rocking, and not be able to put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the sea?"
"So she added, rather differently, one must take them whatever comforts one can."
"'It's due west,' said the atheist Tansley, holding his bony fingers spread so that the wind blew through them, for he was sharing Mr Ramsay's evening walk up and down, up and down the terrace."
"Apart from the habit of exaggeration which they had from her, and from the implication (which was true) that she asked too many people to stay, and had to lodge some in the town, she could not bear incivility to her guests, to young men in particular, who were poor as church mice, 'exceptionally able', her husband said, his great admirers, and come there for a holiday."
"Indeed, she had the whole of the other sex under her protection; for reasons she could not explain, for their chivalry and valour, for the fact that they negotiated treaties, ruled India, controlled finance; finally for an attitude towards herself which no woman could fail to feel or to find agreeable, something trustful, childlike, reverential; which an old woman could take from a young man without loss of dignity, and woe betide the girl _ pray Heaven it was none of her daughters! _ who did not feel the worth of it, and all that it implied, to the marrow of her bones."
"She was now formidable to behold, and it was only in silence, looking up from their plates, after she had spoken so severely about Charles Tansley, that her daughters _ Prue, Nancy, Rose _ could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers; in Paris, perhaps; a wilder life; not always taking care of some man or other; for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry, of the Bank of England and the Indian Empire, of ringed fingers and lace, though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty, which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts, and made them, as they sat at table beneath their mother's eyes, honour her strange severity, her extreme courtesy, like a Queen's raising from the mud a beggar's dirty foot and washing it, when she thus admonished them so very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them to _ or, speaking accurately, been invited to stay with them in _ the Isle of Skye."
"Surely, he had said enough."
"He was such a miserable specimen, the children said, all humps and hollows."
"They knew what he liked best _ to be for ever walking up and down, up and down, with Mr Ramsay, and saying who had won this, who had won that, who was a 'first-rate man' at Latin verses, who was 'brilliant but I think fundamentally unsound', who was undoubtedly the 'ablest fellow in Balliol', who had buried his light temporarily at Bristol or Bedford, but was bound to be heard of later when his Prolegomena, of which Mr Tansley had the first pages in proof with him if Mr Ramsay would like to see them, to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day."
It was him _ his point of view.
"When they talked about something interesting, people, music, history, anything, even said it was a fine evening so why not sit out of doors, then what they complained of about Charles Tansley was that until he had turned the whole thing round and made it somehow reflect himself and disparage them, put them all on edge somehow with his acid way of peeling the flesh and blood off everything, he was not satisfied."
"And he would go to picture galleries, they said, and he would ask one, did one like his tie?"
"Disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinner-table directly the meal was over, the eight sons and daughters of Mr and Mrs Ramsay sought their bedrooms, their fastnesses in a house where there was no other privacy to debate anything, everything; Tansley's tie; the passing of the Reform Bill; sea-birds and butterflies; people; while the sun poured into those attics, which a plank alone separated from each other so that every footstep could be plainly heard and the Swiss girl sobbing for her father who was dying of cancer in a valley of the Grisons, and lit up bats, flannels, straw hats, ink-pots, paint-pots, beetles, and the skulls of small birds, while it drew from the long frilled strips of seaweed pinned to the wall a smell of salt and weeds, which was in the towels too, gritty with sand from bathing."
"Strife, divisions, difference of opinion, prejudices twisted into the very fibre of being, oh that they should begin so early, Mrs Ramsay deplored."
"It seemed to her such nonsense _ inventing differences, when people, heaven knows, were different enough without that."
"The real differences, she thought, standing by the drawing-room window, are enough, quite enough."
"She had in mind at the moment, rich and poor, high and low; the great in birth receiving from her, half grudging, some respect, for had she not in her veins the blood of that very noble, if slightly mythical, Italian house, whose daughters, scattered about English drawing-rooms in the nineteenth century, had lisped so charmingly, had stormed so wildly, and all her wit and her bearing and her temper came from them, and not from the sluggish English, or the cold Scotch; but more profoundly she ruminated the other problem, of rich and poor, and the things she saw with her own eyes, weekly, daily, here or in London, when she visited this widow, or that struggling wife in person with a bag on her arm, and a note-book and pencil with which she wrote down in columns carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spendings, employment and unemployment, in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation, half a relief to her own curiosity, and become, what with her untrained mind she greatly admired, an investigator elucidating the social problem."
"Insoluble questions they were, it seemed to her, standing there, holding James by the hand."
"He had followed her into the drawing-room, that young man they laughed at; he was standing by the table, fidgeting with something, awkwardly, feeling himself out of things, as she knew without looking round."
She had a dull errand in the town; she had a letter or two to write; she would be ten minutes perhaps; she would put on her hat.
"And, with her basket and her parasol, there she was again, ten minutes later, giving out a sense of being ready, of being equipped for a jaunt, which, however, she must interrupt for a moment, as they passed the tennis lawn, to ask Mr Carmichael, who was basking with his yellow cat's eyes ajar, so that like a cat's they seemed to reflect the branches moving or the clouds passing, but to give no inkling of any inner thoughts or emotion whatsoever, if he wanted anything."
"'Stamps, writing-paper, tobacco?' she suggested, stopping by his side."
"His hands clasped themselves over his capacious paunch, his eyes blinked, as if he would have liked to reply kindly to these blandishments (she was seductive but a little nervous) but could not, sunk as he was in a grey-green somnolence which embraced them all, without need of words, in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well-wishing; all the house; all the world; all the people in it, for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something, which accounted, the children thought, for the vivid streak of canary-yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise milk-white."
"Holding her black parasol very erect, and moving with an indescribable air of expectation, as if she were going to meet someone round the corner, she told the story; an affair at Oxford with some girl; an early marriage; poverty; going to India; translating a little poetry 'very beautifully, I believe', being willing to teach the boys Persian or Hindustanee, but what really was the use of that? _ and then lying, as they saw him, on the lawn."
"It flattered him; snubbed as he had been, it soothed him that Mrs Ramsay should tell him this."
"Insinuating, too, as she did the greatness of man's intellect, even in its decay, the subjection of all wives _ not that she blamed the girl, and the marriage had been happy enough, she believed _ to their husband's labours, she made him feel better pleased with himself than he had done yet, and he would have liked, had they taken a cab, for example, to have paid the fare."
"Yes, he felt that in her."
"He felt many things, something in particular that excited him and disturbed him for reasons which he could not give."
"A fellowship, a professorship, _ he felt capable of anything and saw himself _ but what was she looking at?"
"The vast flapping sheet flattened itself out, and each shove of the brush revealed fresh legs, hoops, horses, glistening reds and blues, beautifully smooth, until half the wall was covered with the advertisement of a circus; a hundred horsemen, twenty performing seals, lions, tigers…"
"Craning forwards, for she was short-sighted, she read out how it... 'will visit this town'."
"It was terribly dangerous work for a one-armed man, she exclaimed, to stand on top of the ladder like that _ his left arm had been cut off in a reaping machine two years ago."
"'Let us all go!' she cried, moving on, as if all those riders and horses had filled her with child-like exultation and made her forget her pity."
"Had they not been taken, she asked, to circuses when they were children?"
"He worked hard _ seven hours a day; his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody _ they were walking on and Mrs Ramsay did not quite catch the meaning, only the words, here and there... dissertation... fellowship... readership... lectureship."
"She could not follow the ugly academic jargon, that rattled itself off so glibly, but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch, poor little man, and why he came out, instantly, with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters, and she would see to it that they didn't laugh at him any more; she would tell Prue about it."
"For, though they had reached the town now and were in the main street, with carts grinding past on the cobbles, still he went on talking, about settlements, and teaching, and working men, and helping our own class, and lectures, till she gathered that he had got back entire self-confidence, had recovered from the circus, and was about (and now again she liked him warmly) to tell her _ but here, the houses falling away on both sides, they came out on the quay, and the whole bay spread before them and Mrs Ramsay could not help exclaiming, 'Oh, how beautiful!'"
"For the great plateful of blue water was before her; the hoary Lighthouse, distant, austere, in the midst; and on the right, as far as the eye could see, fading and falling, in soft low pleats, the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them, which always seemed to be running away into some moon country, uninhabited of men."
"There indeed, only a few paces off, stood one of them, in Panama hat and yellow boots, seriously, softly, absorbedly, for all that he was watched by ten little boys, with an air of profound contentment on his round red face, gazing, and then, when he had gazed, dipping; imbuing the tip of his brush in some soft mound of green or pink."
"Since Mr Paunceforte had been there, three years before, all the pictures were like that she said, green and grey, with lemon-coloured sailing-boats, and pink women on the beach."
"There he stood in the parlour of the poky little house where she had taken him, waiting for her, while she went upstairs a moment to see a woman."
"He heard her quick step above, heard her voice cheerful, then low; looked at the mats, tea-caddies, glass shades; waited quite impatiently; looked forward eagerly to the walk home, determined to carry her bag; then heard her come out; shut a door; say they must keep the windows open and the doors shut, ask at the house for anything they wanted (she must be talking to a child), when, suddenly, in she came, stood for a moment silent (as if she had been pretending up there, and for a moment let herself be now), stood quite motionless for a moment against a picture of Queen Victoria wearing the blue ribbon of the Garter; and all at once he realized that it was this: _ she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen."
Stepping through fields of flowers and taking to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had fallen; with the stars in her eyes and the wind in her hair _
"'No going to the Lighthouse, James,' he said, as he stood by the window, speaking awkwardly, but trying in deference to Mrs Ramsay to soften his voice into some semblance of geniality at least."
"'Perhaps you will wake up and find the sun shining and the birds singing,' she said compassionately, smoothing the little boy's hair, for her husband, with his caustic saying that it would not be fine, had dashed his spirits she could see."
"This going to the Lighthouse was a passion of his, she saw, and then, as if her husband had not said enough, with his caustic saying that it would not be fine tomorrow, this odious little man went and rubbed it in all over again."
"All she could do now was to admire the refrigerator, and turn the pages of the Stores list in the hope that she might come upon something like a rake, or a mowing-machine, which, with its prongs and its handles, would need the greatest skill and care in cutting out."
"But here, as she turned the page, suddenly her search for the picture of a rake or a mowing-machine was interrupted."
"The gruff murmur, irregularly broken by the taking out of pipes and the putting in of pipes which had kept on assuring her, though she could not hear what was said (as she sat in the window), that the men were happily talking; this sound which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its place soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her, such as the tap of balls upon bats, the sharp, sudden bark now and then, 'How's that? How's that?' of the children playing cricket, had ceased; so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach, which for the most part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts and seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again as she sat with the children the words of some old cradle song, murmured by nature, 'I am guarding you _ I am your support', but at other times suddenly and unexpectedly, especially when her mind raised itself slightly from the task actually in hand, had no such kindly meaning, but like a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat the measure of life, made one think of the destruction of the island and its engulfment in the sea, and warned her whose day had slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all ephemeral as a rainbow _ this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror."
They had ceased to talk; that was the explanation.
"Falling in one second from the tension which had gripped her to the other extreme which, as if to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of emotion, was cool, amused, and even faintly malicious, she concluded that poor Charles Tansley had been shed."
"One moment more, with her head raised, she listened, as if she waited for some habitual sound, some regular mechanical sound; and then, hearing something rhythmical, half said, half chanted, beginning in the garden, as her husband beat up and down the terrace, something between a croak and a song, she was soothed once more, assured again that all was well, and looking down at the book on her knee found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades which could only be cut out if James was very careful."
"Suddenly a loud cry, as of a sleep-walker, half roused, something about Stormed at with shot and shell sung out with the utmost intensity in her ear, made her turn apprehensively to see if anyone heard him."
But the sight of the girl standing on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her; she was supposed to be keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for Lily's picture.
Lily's picture! Mrs Ramsay smiled.
"Indeed, he almost knocked her easel over, coming down upon her with his hands waving, shouting out 'Boldly we rode and well', but, mercifully, he turned sharp, and rode off, to die gloriously she supposed upon the heights of Balaclava."
"Even while she looked at the mass, at the line, at the colour, at Mrs Ramsay sitting in the window with James, she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest someone should creep up, and suddenly she should find her picture looked at."
"But now, with all her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the colour of the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she was aware of someone coming out of the house, coming towards her; but somehow divined, from the footfall, William Bankes, so that though her brush quivered, she did not, as she would have done had it been Mr Tansley, Paul Rayley, Minta Doyle, or practically anybody else, turn her canvas upon the grass, but let it stand."
"They had rooms in the village, and so, walking in, walking out, parting late on door-mats, had said little things about the soup, about the children, about one thing and another which made them allies; so that when he stood beside her now in his judicial way (he was old enough to be her father too, a botanist, a widower, smelling of soap, very scrupulous and clean) she just stop there."
"Lodging in the same house with her, he had noticed too, how orderly she was, up before breakfast and off to paint, he believed, alone: poor, presumably, and without the complexion or the allurement of Miss Doyle certainly, but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to that young lady."
"Now, for instance, when Ramsay bore down on them, shouting, gesticulating, Miss Briscoe, he felt certain, understood."
"She would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the staring white, since she saw them like that, fashionable though it was, since Mr Paunceforte's visit, to see everything pale, elegant, semitransparent."
It was in that moment's flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child.
"Such she often felt herself _ struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage; to say: 'But this is what I see; this is what I see', and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast, which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her."
"And it was then too, in that chill and windy way, as she began to paint, that there forced themselves upon her other things, her own inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for her father off the Brompton Road, and had much ado to control her impulse to fling herself (thank Heaven she had always resisted so far) at Mrs Ramsay's knee and say to her _ but what could one say to her?"
'I'm in love with you'?
"'I'm in love with this all', waving her hand at the hedge, at the house, at the children?"
"So now she laid her brushes neatly in the box, side by side, and said to William Bankes: 'It suddenly gets cold."
"The sun seems to give less heat,' she said, looking about her, for it was bright enough, the grass still a soft deep green, the house starred in its greenery with purple passion flowers, and rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue."
"It was September after all, the middle of September, and past six in the evening."
"So off they strolled down the garden in the usual direction, past the tennis lawn, past the pampas grass, to that break in the thick hedge, guarded by red-hot pokers like brasiers of clear burning coal, between which the blue waters of the bay looked bluer than ever."
"It was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had grown stagnant on dry land, and gave to their bodies even some sort of physical relief."
"First, the pulse of colour flooded the bay with blue, and the heart expanded with it and the body swam, only the next instant to be checked and chilled by the prickly blackness on the ruffled waves."
"Then, up behind the great black rock, almost every evening spurted irregularly, so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came, a fountain of white water; and then, while one waited for that, one watched, on the pale semicircular beach, wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly a film of mother-of-pearl."
"They both smiled, standing there."
"They both felt a common hilarity, excited by the moving waves; and then by the swift cutting race of a sailing boat, which, having sliced a curve in the bay, stopped; shivered; let its sail drop down; and then, with a natural instinct to complete the picture, after this swift movement, both of them looked at the dunes far away, and instead of merriment felt come over them some sadness _ because the thing was completed partly, and partly because distant views seem to outlast by a million years (Lily thought) the gazer and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest."
"Looking at the far sandhills, William Bankes thought of Ramsay: thought of a road in Westmorland, thought of Ramsay striding along a road by himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air."
"But this was suddenly interrupted, William Bankes remembered (and this must refer to some actual incident), by a hen, straddling her wings out in protection of a covey of little chicks, upon which Ramsay, stopping, pointed his stick and said 'Pretty _ pretty,' an odd illumination into his heart, Bankes had thought it, which showed his simplicity, his sympathy with humble things; but it seemed to him as if their friendship had ceased, there, on that stretch of road."
"Whose fault it was he could not say, only, after a time, repetition had taken the place of newness."
"But in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes he maintained that his affection for Ramsay had in no way diminished; but there like the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century, with the red fresh on his lips, was his friendship, in its acuteness and reality laid up across the bay among the sandhills."
"He was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and shrunk _ for Ramsay lived in a welter of children, whereas Bankes was childless and a widower _ he was anxious that Lily Briscoe should not disparage Ramsay (a great man in his own way) yet should understand how things stood between them."
"Begun long years ago, their friendship had petered out on a Westmorland road, where the hen spread her wings before her chicks; after which Ramsay had married, and their paths lying different ways, there had been, certainly for no one's fault, some tendency, when they met, to repeat."
"And, turning to walk back the other way, up the drive, Mr Bankes was alive to things which would not have struck him had not those sandhills revealed to him the body of his friendship lying with the red on its lips laid up in peat _ for instance, Cam, the little girl, Ramsay's youngest daughter."
No! no! no! she would not!
To feed eight children on philosophy!
"Here was another of them, Jasper this time, strolling past, to have a shot at a bird, he said, nonchalantly, swinging Lily's hand like a pump-handle as he passed, which caused Mr Bankes to say, bitterly, how she was a favourite."
"There was education now to be considered (true, Mrs Ramsay had something of her own perhaps) let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those 'great fellows', all well grown, angular, ruthless youngsters, must require."
"He called them privately after the Kings and Queens of England; Cam the Wicked, James the Ruthless, Andrew the Just, Prue the Fair _ for Prue would have beauty, he thought, how could she help it? _ and Andrew brains."
"While he walked up the drive and Lily Briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed Ramsay's case, commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities."
"They gave him something _ William Bankes acknowledged that; it would have been pleasant if Cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered over his shoulder, as over her father's, to look at a picture of Vesuvius in eruption; but they had also, his old friends could not but feel, destroyed something."
It was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he did _ but that was too harsh a phrase _ could depend so much as he did upon people's praise.
Whenever she 'thought of his work' she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table.
It was Andrew's doing.
She asked him what his father's books were about.
"'Think of a kitchen table then,' he told her, 'when you are not there.'"
"So she always saw, when she thought of Mr Ramsay's work, a scrubbed kitchen table."
"And with a painful effort of concentration, she focused her mind, not upon the silver-bossed bark of the tree, or upon its fish-shaped leaves, but upon a phantom kitchen table, one of those scrubbed board tables, grained and knotted, whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity, which stuck there, its four legs in air."
"Naturally, if one's days were passed in this seeing of angular essences, this reducing of lovely evenings, with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four-legged table (and it was a mark of the finest minds so to do), naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person."
"But the number of men who make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small, he said, pausing by the pear tree, well brushed, scrupulously exact, exquisitely judicial."
"Suddenly, as if the movement of his hand had released it, the load of her accumulated impressions of him tilted up, and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she felt about him."
"I respect you (she addressed him silently) in every atom; you are not vain; you are entirely impersonal; you are finer than Mr Ramsay; you are the finest human being that I know; you have neither wife nor child (without any sexual feeling, she longed to cherish that loneliness), you live for science (involuntarily, sections of potatoes rose before her eyes); praise would be an insult to you; generous, pure-hearted, heroic man!"
"And to those words, what meaning attached, after all?"
"Standing now, apparently transfixed, by the pear tree, impressions poured in upon her of those two men, and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one's pencil, and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting undeniable, everlasting, contradictory things, so that even the fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity."
"He is petty, selfish, vain, egotistical; he is spoilt; he is a tyrant; he wears Mrs Ramsay to death; but he has what you (she addressed Mr Bankes) have not; a fiery unworldliness; he knows nothing about trifles; he loves dogs and his children."
"All of this danced up and down, like a company of gnats, each separate, but all marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic net _ danced up and down in Lily's mind, in and about the branches of the pear tree, where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table, symbol of her profound respect for Mr Ramsay's mind, until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity; she felt released; a shot went off close at hand, and there came, flying from its fragments, frightened effusive, tumultuous, a flock of starlings."
"His eyes, glazed with emotion, defiant with tragic intensity, met theirs for a second, and trembled on the verge of recognition; but then, raising his hand half-way to his face as if to avert, to brush off, in an agony of peevish shame, their normal gaze, as if he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be inevitable, as if he impressed upon them his own child-like resentment of interruption, yet even in the moment of discovery was not to be routed utterly, but was determined to hold fast to something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which he was ashamed, but in which he revelled _ he turned abruptly, slammed his private door on them; and, Lily Briscoe and Mr Bankes, looking uneasily up into the sky, observed that the flock of starlings which Jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees."
"And now,' she said, thinking that Lily's charm was her Chinese eyes, aslant in her white, puckered little face, but it would take a clever man to see it, 'and now stand up, and let me measure your leg,' for they might go to the Lighthouse after all, and she must see if the stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg."
"Smiling, for an admirable idea had flashed upon her this very second _ William and Lily should marry _ she took the heather mixture stocking, with its criss-cross of steel needles at the mouth of it, and measured it against James's leg."
"'My dear, stand still,' she said, for in his jealousy, not liking to serve as measuring-block for the Lighthouse keeper's little boy, James fidgeted purposely; and if he did that, how could she see, was it too long, was it too short? she asked."
"She looked up _ what demon possessed him, her youngest, her cherished? _ and saw the room, saw the chairs, thought them fearfully shabby."
"Never mind: the rent was precisely twopence halfpenny; the children loved it; it did her husband good to be three thousand, or if she must be accurate, three hundred miles from his library and his lectures and his disciples; and there was room for visitors."
"Mats, camp beds, crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose London life of service was done _ they did well enough here; and a photograph or two, and books."
She never had time to read them.
"And Croom on the Mind and Bates on the Savage Customs of Polynesia ('My dear, stand still,' she said) _ neither of those could one send to the Lighthouse."
If they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them _ that would be something.
"Crabs, she had to allow, if Andrew really wished to dissect them, or if Jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed, one could not prevent it; or Rose's objects _ shells, reeds, stones; for they were gifted, her children, but all in quite different ways."
"And the result of it was, she sighed, taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling, as she held the stocking against James's leg, that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer."
What was the use of flinging a green Cashmere shawl over the edge of a picture frame?
In two weeks it would be the colour of pea soup.
"She would go into the maids' bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens, except for Marie's, the Swiss girl, who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air, but then at home, she had said, 'the mountains are so beautiful.'"
She had stood there silent for there was nothing to be said.
He had cancer of the throat.
"At the recollection _ how she had stood there, how the girl had said, 'At home the mountains are so beautiful', and there was no hope, no hope whatever, she had a spasm of irritation, and speaking sharply, said to James: 'Stand still."
"Don't be tiresome,' so that he knew instantly that her severity was real, and straightened his leg and she measured it."
"The stocking was too short by half an inch at least, making allowance for the fact that Sorley's little boy would be less well grown than James."
"'It's too short,' she said, 'ever so much too short.'"
"Or was there nothing? nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind, and could do nothing to disturb?"
"For easily though she might have said at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion, of love foiled, of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or felt or been through it herself, she never spoke."
"He saw her at the end of the line, Greek, blue-eyed, straight-nosed."
The Graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face.
"'But she's no more aware of her beauty than a child,' said Mr Bankes, replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house."
She clapped a deer-stalker's hat on her head; she ran across the lawn in goloshes to snatch a child from mischief.
"So that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of, one must remember the quivering thing, the living thing (they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them), and work it into the picture; or if one thought of her simply as a woman, one must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasy; or suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty, and she wanted only to be like other people, insignificant."
He did not know.
"Knitting her reddish-brown hairy stocking, with her head outlined absurdly by the gilt frame, the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of the frame, and the authenticated masterpiece by Michael Angelo, Mrs Ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before, raised his head, and kissed her little boy on the forehead."
Starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time.
But she could not for the life of her think what.
"Not for the world would she have spoken to him, realizing, from the familiar signs, his eyes averted, and some curious gathering together of his person, as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into which to regain his equilibrium, that he was outraged and anguished."
"She stroked James's head; she transferred to him what she felt for her husband, and, as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the Army and Navy Stores catalogue, thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn out a great artist; and why should he not?"
"Then, looking up, as her husband passed her once more, she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled; domesticity triumphed; custom crooned its soothing rhythm, so that when stopping deliberately, as his turn came round again, at the window he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle James's bare calf with a sprig of something, she twitted him for having dispatched 'that poor young man', Charles Tansley."
"Hating his father, James brushed away the tickling spray with which in a manner peculiar to him, compound of severity and humour, he teased his youngest son's bare leg."
"She was trying to get these tiresome stockings finished to send to Sorley's little boy tomorrow, said Mrs Ramsay."
"There wasn't the slightest possible chance that they could go to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mr Ramsay snapped out irascibly."
"He had ridden through the valley of death, been shattered and shivered; and now she flew in the face of facts, made his children hope what was utterly out of the question, in effect, told lies."
He stamped his foot on the stone step.
"To pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people's feelings, to rend the thin veils of civilization so wantonly, so brutally, was to her so horrible an outrage of human decency that, without replying, dazed and blinded, she bent her head as if to let the pelt of jagged hail, the drench of dirty water, bespatter her unrebuked."
He stood by her in silence.
"Very humbly, at length, he said that he would step over and ask the Coastguards if she liked."
"They came to her, naturally, since she was a woman, all day long with this and that; one wanting this, another that; the children were growing up; she often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions."
"He said, It won't rain; and instantly a Heaven of security opened before her."
"She was not good enough to tie his shoe strings, she felt."
"Already ashamed of that petulance, of that gesticulation of the hands when charging at the head of his troops, Mr Ramsay rather sheepishly prodded his son's bare legs once more, and then, as if he had her leave for it, with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the Zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank washes from side to side, he dived into the evening air which, already thinner, was taking the substance from leaves and hedges but, as if in return, restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which they had not had by day."
But how extraordinarily his note had changed!
"It was like the cuckoo; 'in June he gets out of tune'; as if he were trying over, tentatively seeking, some phrase for a new mood, and having only this at hand, used it, cracked though it was."
"Mrs Ramsay could not help smiling, and soon, sure enough, walking up and down, he hummed it, dropped it, fell silent."
"He stopped to light his pipe, looked once at his wife and son in the window, and as one raises one's eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm, a tree, a cluster of cottages as an illustration, a confirmation of something on the printed page to which one returns, fortified, and satisfied, so without his distinguishing either his son or his wife, the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind."
"Here, stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums, he saw, but now far far away, like children picking up shells, divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived, his wife and son, together, in the window."
"After Q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes, but glimmers red in the distance."
"Here he knocked his pipe out, with two or three resonant taps on the ram's horn which made the handle of the urn, and proceeded."
"Qualities that would have saved a ship's company exposed on a broiling sea with six biscuits and a flask of water _ endurance and justice, foresight, devotion, skill, came to his help."
In that flash of darkness he heard people saying _ he was a failure _ that R was beyond him.
"The geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and, displayed among its leaves, he could see, without wishing it, that old, that obvious distinction between the two classes of men; on the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who, plodding and persevering, repeat the whole alphabet in order, twenty-six letters in all, from start to finish; on the other the gifted, the inspired who, miraculously, lump all the letters together in one flash _ the way of genius."
"He had not genius; he laid no claim to that: but he had, or might have had, the power to repeat every letter of the alphabet from A to Z accurately in order."
"Meanwhile, he stuck at Q."
"Feelings that would not have disgraced a leader who, now that the snow has begun to fall and the mountain-top is covered in mist, knows that he must lay himself down and die before morning comes, stole upon him, paling the colour of his eyes, giving him, even in the two minutes of his turn on the terrace, the bleached look of withered old age."
"He stood stock still, by the urn, with the geranium flowing over it."
"How many men in a thousand million, he asked himself, reach Z after all?"
"Surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself that, and answer, without treachery to the expedition behind him, 'One perhaps'."
It is permissible even for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter.
"(He looked into the darkness, into the intricacy of the twigs.)"
"Who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the perishing of stars, if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow, and square his shoulders, so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at his post, the fine figure of a soldier?"
"Who shall blame him, if, so standing for a moment, he dwells upon fame, upon search parties, upon cairns raised by grateful followers over his bones?"
"Finally, who shall blame the leader of the doomed expedition, if, having adventured to the uttermost, and used his strength wholly to the last ounce and fallen asleep not much caring if he wakes or not, he now perceives by some pricking in his toes that he lives, and does not on the whole object to live, but requires sympathy, and whisky, and someone to tell the story of his suffering to at once?"
"Who will not secretly rejoice when the hero puts his armour off, and halts by the window and gazes at his wife and son, who very distant at first, gradually come closer and closer, till lips and book and head are clearly before him, though still lovely and unfamiliar from the intensity of his isolation and the waste of ages and the perishing of the stars, and finally putting his pipe in his pocket and bending his magnificent head before her _ who will blame him if he does homage to the beauty of the world?"
"He hated him for coming up to them, for stopping and looking down on them; he hated him for interrupting them; he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures; for the magnificence of his head; for his exactingness and egotism (for there he stood, commanding them to attend him); but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father's emotion which, vibrating round them, disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother."
"By looking fixedly at the page, he hoped to make him move on; by pointing his finger at a word, he hoped to recall his mother's attention, which, he knew angrily, wavered instantly his father stopped."
"Mrs Ramsay, who had been sitting loosely, folding her son in her arm, braced herself, and, half turning, seemed to raise herself with an effort, and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy, a column of spray, looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force, burning and illuminating (quietly though she sat, taking up her stocking again), and into this delicious fecundity, this fountain and spray of life, the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself, like a beak of brass, barren and bare."
"It was sympathy he wanted, to be assured of his genius, first of all, and then to be taken within the circle of life, warmed and soothed, to have his senses restored to him, his barrenness made fertile, and all the rooms of the house made full of life _ the drawing-room; behind the drawing-room the kitchen; above the kitchen the bedrooms; and beyond them the nurseries; they must be furnished, they must be filled with life."
"Flashing her needles, confident, upright, she created drawing-room and kitchen, set them all aglow; bade him take his ease there, go in and out, enjoy himself."
"Standing between her knees, very stiff, James felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of the male, which smote mercilessly, again and again, demanding sympathy."
"Flashing her needles, glancing round about her, out of the window, into the room, at James himself, she assured him, beyond a shadow of a doubt, by her laugh, her poise, her competence (as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child), that it was real; the house was full; the garden blowing."
"So boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by; all was so lavished and spent; and James, as he stood stiff between her knees, felt her rise in a rosy-flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of his father, the egotistical man, plunged and smote, demanding sympathy."
"Filled with her words, like a child who drops off satisfied, he said, at last, looking at her with humble gratitude, restored, renewed, that he would take a turn; he would watch the children playing cricket."
"Immediately, Mrs Ramsay seemed to fold herself together, one petal closed in another, and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself, so that she had only strength enough to move her finger, in exquisite abandomnent to exhaustion, across the page of Grimm's fairy story, while there throbbed through her, like the pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat, the rapture of successful creation."
"Yet, as the resonance died, and she turned to the Fairy Tale again, Mrs Ramsay felt not only exhausted in body (afterwards, not at the time, she always felt this) but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin."
"Not that, as she read aloud the story of the Fisherman's Wife, she knew precisely what it came from; nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized, at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully, ominously, a wave fall, how it came from this: she did not like, even for a second, to feel finer than her husband; and further, could not bear not being entirely sure, when she spoke to him, of the truth of what she said."
"Universities and people wanting him, lectures and books and their being of the highest importance _ all that she did not doubt for a moment; but it was their relation, and his coming to her like that, openly, so that anyone could see, that discomposed her; for then people said he depended on her, when , they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important, and what she gave the world, in comparison with what he gave, negligible."
"But then again, it was the other thing too _ not being able to tell him the truth, being afraid, for instance, about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be, fifty pounds perhaps, to mend it; and then about his books, to be afraid that he might guess, what she a little suspected, that his last book was not quite his best book (she gathered that from William Bankes); and then to hide small daily things, and the children seeing it, and the burden it laid on them _ all this diminished the entire joy, the pure joy, of the two notes sounding together, and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness."
"It was Augustus Carmichael shuffling past, precisely now, at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships, that the most perfect was flawed, and could not bear the examination which, loving her husband, with her instinct for truth, she turned upon it; when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness, and impeded in her proper function by these lies, these exaggerations, _ it was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation, that Mr Carmichael shuffled past, in his yellow slippers, and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out, as he passed, 'Going indoors, Mr Carmichael?'"
The children said he had stained his beard yellow with it.
"She remembered that iniquity of his wife's towards him, which had made her turn to steel and adamant there, in the horrid little room in St John's Wood, when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house."
Never did she show a sign of not wanting him.
"And after all _ after all (here insensibly she drew herself together, physically, the sense of her own beauty becoming, as it did so seldom, present to her) _ after all, she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her; for instance, George Manning; Mr Wallace; famous as they were, they would come to her of an evening, quietly, and talk alone over her fire."
"She bore about with her, she could not help knowing it, the torch of her beauty; she carried it erect into any room that she entered; and after all, veil it as she might, and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her, her beauty was apparent."
"And yet not cleanly, not rightly."
"That was what she minded, coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband; the sense she had now when Mr Carmichael shuffled past, just nodding to her question, with a book beneath his arm, in his yellow slippers, that she was suspected; and that all this desire of hers to give, to help, was vanity."
"Shabby and worn out, and not presumably (her cheeks were hollow, her hair was white) any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy, she had better devote her mind to the story of the Fisherman and his Wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness (none of her children was as sensitive as he was), her son James."
"'The man's heart grew heavy,' she read aloud, 'and he would not go."
"He slipped seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause, signified some conclusion, seeing his wife and child, seeing again the urns with the trailing red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought, and bore, written up among their leaves, as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of reading _ he slipped, seeing all this, smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in The Times about the number of Americans who visit Shakespeare's house every year."
Possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class.
"To avoid it, he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts."
"All this would have to be dished up for the young men at Cardiff next month, he thought; here, on his terrace, he was merely foraging and picnicking (he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly) like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses, or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood."
"Hours he would spend thus, with his pipe, of an evening, thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons, which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there, the life of this statesman here, with poems and with anecdotes, with figures too, this thinker, that soldier; all very brisk and clear; but at length the lane, the field, the common, the fruitful nut-tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always, tied his horse to a tree, and proceeded on foot alone."
"It was his fate, his peculiarity, whether he wished it or not, to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away, and there to stand, like a desolate seabird, alone."
"It was his power, his gift, suddenly to shed all superfluities, to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer, even physically, yet lost none of his intensity of mind, and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance, how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on _ that was his fate, his gift."
"But having thrown away, when he dismounted, all gestures and fripperies, all trophies of nuts and roses, and shrunk so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten by him, he kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision, and it was in this guise that he inspired in William Bankes (intermittently) and in Charles Tansley (obsequiously) and in his wife now, when she looked up and saw him standing at the edge of the lawn, profound reverence, and pity, and gratitude too, as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry boat-loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it has taken upon itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone."
"He turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on, which, had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something; and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over, to deprecate it, as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes."
"It was true; he was for the most part happy; he had his wife; he had his children; he had promised in six weeks' time to talk 'some nonsense' to the young men of Cardiff about Locke, Hume, Berkeley, and the causes of the French Revolution."
"But this and his pleasure in it, in the phrases he made, in the ardour of youth, in his wife's beauty, in the tributes that reached him from Swansea, Cardiff, Exeter, Southampton, Kidderminster, Oxford, Cambridge _ all had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase 'talking nonsense', because, in effect, he had not done the thing he might have done."
"It was a disguise; it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own feelings, who could not say, This is what I like _ this is what I am; and rather pitiable and distasteful to William Bankes and Lily Briscoe, who wondered why such concealments should be necessary; why he needed always praise; why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life; how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time."
"Then the change must be so upsetting, Lily said."
Now he stopped dead and stood looking in silence at the sea.
(Lily had said something about his frightening her _ he changed from one mood to another so suddenly.)
"A crusty old grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold, why should he preach to us? was what Mr Bankes understood that young people said nowadays."
But in her opinion one liked Mr Ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little finger ached the whole world must come to an end.
"What she disliked was his narrowness, his blindness, she said, looking after him."
"'A bit of a hypocrite?' Mr Bankes suggested, looking, too, at Mr Ramsay's back, for was he not thinking of his friendship, and of Cam refusing to give him a flower, and of all those boys and girls, and his own house, full of comfort, but, since his wife's death, quiet rather?"
"Oh no _ the most sincere of men, the truest (here he was), the best; but, looking down, she thought, he is absorbed in himself, he is tyrannical, he is unjust; and kept looking down, purposely, for only so could she keep steady, staying with the Ramsays."
"Directly one looked up and saw them, what she called 'being in love' flooded them."
"And, what was even more exciting, she felt, too, as she saw Mr Ramsay bearing down and retreating, and Mrs Ramsay sitting with James in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending, how life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up with it and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the beach."
"And she was about to say something criticizing Mrs Ramsay, how she was alarming, too, in her way, high-handed, or words to that effect, when Mr Bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture."
"For such it was considering his age, turned sixty, and his cleanliness and his impersonality, and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him."
"For him to gaze as Lily saw him gazing at Mrs Ramsay was a rapture, equivalent, Lily felt, to the loves of dozens of young men (and perhaps Mrs Ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men)."
"The world by all means should have shared it, could Mr Bankes have said why that woman pleased him so; why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem, so that he rested in contemplation of it, and felt, as he felt when he had proved something absolute about the digestive system of plants, that barbarity was tamed, the reign of chaos subdued."
Such a rapture _ for by what other name could one call it? _ made Lily Briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say.
"It paled beside this 'rapture', this silent stare, for which she felt intense gratitude; for nothing so solaced her, eased her of the perplexity of life, and miraculously raised its burdens, as this sublime power, this heavenly gift, and one would no more disturb it, while it lasted, than break up the shaft of sunlight lying level across the floor."
She saw the colour burning on a framework of steel; the light of a butterfly's wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral.
Of all that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained.
"Looking along his beam she added to it her different ray, thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people (bowed over her book); the best perhaps; but also, different too from the perfect shape which one saw there."
"But why different, and how different? she asked herself, scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now, yet she vowed, she would inspire them, force them to move, flow, do her bidding tomorrow."
"She was wilful; she was commanding (of course, Lily reminded herself, I am thinking of her relations with women, and I am much younger, an insignificant person, living off the Brompton Road)."
(So she tried to start the tune of Mrs Ramsay in her head.)
"Arriving late at night, with a light tap on one's bedroom door, wrapped in an old fur coat (for the setting of her beauty was always that _ hasty, but apt), she would enact again whatever it might be _ Charles Tansley losing his umbrella; Mr Carmichael snuffling and sniffing; Mr Bankes saying, 'the vegetables salts are lost'."
"All this she would adroitly shape; even maliciously twist; and, moving over to the window, in pretence that she must go, _ it was dawn, she could see the sun rising, _ half turn back, more intimately, but still always laughing, insist that she must, Minta must, they all must marry, since in the whole world, whatever laurels might be tossed to her (but Mrs Ramsay cared not a fig for her painting), or triumphs won by her (probably Mrs Ramsay had had her share of those), and here she saddened, darkened, and came back to her chair, there could be no disputing this: an unmarried woman (she lightly took her hand for a moment), an unmarried woman has missed the best of life."
The house seemed full of children sleeping and Mrs Ramsay listening; of shaded lights and regular breathing.
"Yet, as the night wore on, and white lights parted the curtains, and even now and then some bird chirped in the garden, gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption from the universal law; plead for it; she liked to be alone; she liked to be herself; she was not made for that; and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled depth, and confront Mrs Ramsay's simple certainty (and she was childlike now) that her dear Lily, her little Brisk, was a fool."
"Then, she remembered, she had laid her head on Mrs Ramsay's lap and laughed and laughed and laughed, laughed almost hysterically at the thought of Mrs Ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand."
"Lily Briscoe had looked up at last, and there was Mrs Ramsay, unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter, still presiding, but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished, and in its stead, something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncover _ the little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon."
"Was it, once more, the deceptiveness of beauty, so that all one's perceptions, half-way to truth, were tangled in a golden mesh? or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly Lily Briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all?"
"Sitting on the floor with her arms round Mrs Ramsay's knees, close as she could get, smiling to think that Mrs Ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure, she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was, physically, touching her, were stood, like the treasures in the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them out would teach one everything, but they would never be offered openly, never made public."
Nothing! as she lent her head against Mrs Ramsay's knee.
"Only like a bee, drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste, one haunted the dome-shaped hive, ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone, and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings; the hives which were people."
"For days there hung about her, as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of, more vividly than anything she said, the sound of murmuring and, as she sat in the wicker arm-chair in the drawing-room window she wore, to Lily's eyes, an august shape; the shape of a dome."
"He had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes, when Lily, rousing herself, saw what he was at, and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it."
"She would have snatched her picture off the easel, but she said to herself, One must."
"And if it must be seen, Mr Bankes was less alarming than another."
"But that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty-three years, the deposit of each day's living, mixed with something more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course af all those days was an agony."
"Taking out a penknife, Mr Bankes tapped the canvas with the bone handle."
"Mother and child then _ objects of universal veneration, and in this case the mother was famous for her beauty _ might be reduced, he pondered, to a purple shadow without irreverence."
"There were other senses, too, in which one might reverence them."
"He had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the Kennet, he said."
"The question being one of the relations of masses, of lights and shadows, which, to be honest, he had never considered before, he would like to have it explained _ what then did she wish to make of it?"
"She took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent-minded manner, subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general; becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and children _ her picture."
But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken.
"And, thanking Mr Ramsay for it and Mrs Ramsay for it and the hour and the place, crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected, that one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody _ the strangest feeling in the world, and the most exhilarating _ she nicked the catch of her paint-box to, more firmly than was necessary, and the nick seemed to surround in a circle for ever the paint-box, the lawn, Mr Bankes, and that wild villain, Cam, dashing past."
"It might be a vision _ of a shell, of a wheelbarrow, of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge; or it might be the glory of speed; no one knew."
"What was she dreaming about, Mrs Ramsay wondered, seeing her engrossed, as she stood there, with some thought of her own, so that she had to repeat the message twice _ ask Mildred if Andrew, Miss Doyle, and Mr Rayley have come back?"
"And indeed it was only by waiting patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that Mrs Ramsay at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up Mildred's words quite accurately and could now produce them, if one waited, in a colourless singsong."
"This going off after luncheon for a walk, even though Andrew was with them _ what could it mean? except that she had decided, rightly, Mrs Ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond of Minta), to accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant, but then, thought Mrs Ramsay, realizing that James was tugging at her to make her go on reading aloud the Fisherman and his Wife, she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations; Charles Tansley for instance."
"Anyhow it must have happened, one way or the other, by now."
Not if she agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country alone _ for Andrew would be off after his crabs _ but possibly Nancy was with them.
She tried to recall the sight of them standing at the hall door after lunch.
"There they stood, looking at the sky, wondering about the weather, and she had said, thinking partly to cover their shyness, partly to encourage them to be off (for her sympathies were with Paul), 'There isn't a cloud anywhere within miles,' at which she could feel little Charles Tansley, who had followed them out, snigger."
"Whether Nancy was there or not, she could not be certain, looking from one to the other in her mind's eye."
"And where were they now? Mrs Ramsay wondered, reading and thinking, quite easily, both at the same time; for the story of the Fisherman and his Wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune, which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody."
"For she could not go trapesing about all over the country, even if Nancy were with them (she tried again, unsuccessfully, to visualize their backs going down the path, and to count them)."
She was responsible to Minta's parents _ the Owl and the Poker.
"The Owl and the Poker _ yes, they would be annoyed if they heard _ and they were certain to hear _ that Minta, staying with the Ramsays, had been seen etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
"Dear dear, Mrs Ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this incongruous daughter? this tomboy Minta, with a hole in her stocking?"
"How did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had scattered, and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits _ interesting perhaps, but limited after all _ of that bird?"
"Naturally, one had asked her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay with them up at Finlay, which had resulted in some friction with the Owl, her mother, and more calling, and more conversation, and more sand, and really at the end of it, she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said to her husband that night, coming back from the party)."
"Yes, she came, Mrs Ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this: a woman had once accused her of 'robbing her of her daughter's affections'; something Mrs Doyle had said made her remember that charge again."
No one could accuse her of taking pains to impress.
"About things like that she did feel passionately, and would, if she had had the chance, have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see."
"And Nancy and Roger, they were both wild creatures now, scampering about over the country all day long."
"As for Rose, her mouth was too big, but she had a wonderful gift with her hands."
"Why, she asked, pressing her chin on James's head, should they grow up so fast?"
A tenpenny tea set made Cam happy for days
She heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they woke.
"Then the door sprang open and in they came, fresh as roses, staring, wide awake, as if this coming into the dining-room after breakfast, which they did every day of their lives was a positive event to them; and so on, with one thing after another, all day long, until she went up to say good-night to them, and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries still making up stories about some little bit of rubbish _ something they had heard, something they had picked up in the garden."
"Only she thought life _ and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes, her fifty years."
"She took a look at life, for she had a clear sense of it there, something real, something private, which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband."
"A sort of transaction went on between them, in which she was on one side, and life was on another, and she was always trying to get the better of it, as it was of her; and sometimes they parleyed (when she sat alone); there were, she remembered, great reconciliation scenes; but for the most part, oddly enough, she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible, hostile, and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance."
There was always a woman dying of cancer even here.
To eight people she had said relentlessly that (and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds).
"And here she was, she reflected, feeling life rather sinister again, making Minta marry Paul Rayley; because whatever she might feel about her own transaction and she had had experiences which need not happen to everyone (she did not name them to herself); she was driven on, too quickly she knew, almost as if it were an escape for her too, to say that people must marry; people must have children."
Marriage needed _ oh all sorts of qualities (the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds); one _ she need not name it _ that was essential; the thing she had with her husband.
"'But outside a great storm was raging and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet; houses and trees toppled over, the mountains trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was pitch black, and it thundered and lightened, and the sea came in with black waves as high as church towers and mountains, and all with white foam at the top.'"
"She turned the page; there were only a few lines more, so that she would finish the story, though it was past bedtime."
The light in the garden told her that; and the whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety.
What it was about she could not think at first.
"She summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in front of the hall door, standing looking up into the sky."
"But she did not let her voice change in the least as she finished the story, and added, shutting the book, and speaking the last words as if she had made them up herself, looking into James's eyes: 'And there they are living still at this very time.'"
It had been lit.
"In a moment he would ask her, 'Are we going to the Lighthouse?'"
"But he kept looking back over his shoulder as Mildred carried him out, and she was certain that he was thinking, we are not going to the Lighthouse tomorrow; and she thought, he will remember that all his life."
"No, she thought, putting together some of the picctures be had cut out _ a refrigerator, a mowing machine, a gentleman in evening dress _ children never forget."
"All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others."
"And to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources, she supposed; one after another, she, Lily, Augustus Carmichael, must feel our apparitions, the things you know us by, are simply childish."
"Beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is unfathomably deep; but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by."
There were all the places she had not seen; the Indian plains; she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in Rome.
"This core of darkness could go anywhere, for no one saw it."
"There was freedom, there was peace, there was, most welcome of all, a summoning together, a resting on a platform of stability."
"Not as oneself did one find rest ever, in her experience (she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles), but as a wedge of darkness."
"Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry, the stir; and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace, this rest, this eternity; and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the Lighthouse, the long steady stroke, the last of the three, which was her stroke, for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw; and htis thing, the long steady stroke, was her stroke."
"It will come, it will come, when suddenly she added, We are in the hands of the Lord."
"She looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes, searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart, purifying out of existence that lie, any lie."
What brought her to say that: 'We are in the hands of the Lord?' she wondered.
"With her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason, order, justice: but suffering, death, the poor."
"She knitted with firm composure, slightly pursing her lips and, without being aware of it, so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed, though he was chuckling at the thought that Hume, the philosopher, grown enormously fat, had stuck in a bog, he could not help noting, as he passed, the sternness at the heart of her beauty."
"It saddened him, and her remoteness pained him, and he felt, as he passed, that he could not protect her, and, when he reached the hedge, he was sad."
He had lost his temper over the Lighthouse.
"Always, Mrs Ramsay felt, one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end, some sound, some sight."
"She listened, but it was all very still; cricket was over; the children were in their baths; there was only the sound of the sea."
She stopped knitting; she held the long reddish-brown stocking dangling in her hands a moment.
"With some irony in her interrogation, for when one woke at all, one's relations changed, she looked at the steady light, the pitiless, the remorseless, which was so much her, yet so little her, which had her at its beck and call (she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed, stroking the floor), but for all that she thought, watching it with fascination, hypnotized, as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight, she had known happiness, exquisite happiness, intense happiness, and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly, as daylight faded, and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemmon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt, It is enough!"
"His beauty was so great, she said, beginning to speak of Kennedy the gardener at once; he was so awfully handsome, that she couldn't dismiss him."
"There was a ladder against the greenhouse, and little lumps of putty stuck about, for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse roof."
"She had it on the tip of her tongue to say, as they strolled, 'It'll cost fifty pounds', but instead, for her heart failed her about money, she talked about Jasper shooting birds, and he said, at once, sooting her instantly, that it was natural in a boy, and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself before long."
"She supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices, Mrs Ramsay said, wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs; did they plant them?"
"She knew all about that, said Mrs Ramsay."
It was about the influence of somebody upon something.
"'Pray Heaven he won't fall in love with Prue,' said Mrs Ramsay."
"There was no harm in him, he added, and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in England who admired his _ when he choked it back."
"These flowers seemed creditable, Mr Ramsay said, lowering his gaze and noticing something red, something brown."
"'Nobody ever held up your Aunt Camilla as a model of virtue that I'm aware of,' said Mr Ramsay."
He wished Andrew could be induced to work harder.
He would lose every chance of a scholarship if he didn't.
'Oh scholarships!' she said.
"He should be very proud of Andrew if he got a scholarship, he said."
"She would be just as proud of him if he didn't, she answered."
"She liked him to believe in scholarships, and he liked her to be proud of Andrew whatever he did."
Suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs.
Andrew could look after himself.
"What had he wanted to tell her, she asked, thinking it was about going to the Lighthouse; and that he was sorry he had said 'Damn you'."
"She had been reading fairy tales to James, she said."
"They had reached the gap between the two clumps of red-hot pokers, and there was the Lighthouse again, but she would not let herself look at it."
"Had she known that he was looking at her, she thought, she would not have let herself sit there, thinking."
The lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind.
"He wanted to go on thinking, telling himself the story how Hume was stuck in a bog; he wanted to laugh."
"When he was Andrew's age he used to walk about the country all day long, with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him, or thought that he had fallen over a cliff."
He said aloud he thought he would be off for a day's walk if the weather held.
He had had about enough of Bankes and of Carmichael.
He would like a little solitude.
He was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket.
"Years ago, before he had married, he thought, looking across the bay, as they stood between the clumps of red-hot pokers, he had walked all day."
He had worked ten hours at a stretch; an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire.
"That was the country he liked best, over there; those sandhills dwindling away into darkness."
There were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time.
The father of eight children _ he reminded himself.
"They showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely, for on an evening like this, he thought, looking at the land dwindling away, the little island seemed pathetically small, half swallowed up in the sea."
"He said the most melancholy things, but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual."
"All this phrase-making was a game, she thought, for if she had said half what he said, she would have blown her brains out by now."
"It annoyed her, this phrase-making, and she said to him, in a matter-of-fact way, that it was a perfectly lovely evening."
"And what was he groaning about, she asked, half laughing, half complaining, for she guessed what he was thinking _ he would have written better books if he had not married."
She knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of.
"And he seized her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that brought the tears to her eyes, and quickly he dropped it."
"They turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the silver-green spear-like plants grew, arm in arm."
"His arm was almost like a young man's arm, Mrs Ramsay thought, thin and hard, and she thought with delight how strong he still was, though he was over sixty, and how untamed and optimistic, and how strange it was that being convinced, as he was, of all sorts of horrors, seemed not to depress him, but to cheer him."
"And his habit of talking aloud, or saying poetry aloud, was growing on him, she was afraid; for sometimes it was awkward _ Best and brightest, come away! poor Miss Giddings, when he shouted that at her, almost jumped out of her skin."
"But then, Mrs Ramsay, though instantly taking his side against all the silly Giddingses in the world, then, she thought, intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too fast for her, and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were fresh mole-hills on the bank, then, she thought, stooping down to look, a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours."
"But without shooting rabbits, how was one to keep them down? she wondered."
"And looking up, she saw above the thin trees the first pulse of the full- throbbing star, and wanted to make her husband look at it; for the sight gave her such keen pleasure."
"His wife had been in bad health for many years, so that their sight-seeing had been on a modest scale."
"She had been to Dresden; there were masses of pictures she had not seen; however, Lily Briscoe reflected, perhaps it was better not to see pictures: they only made one hopelessly discontented with one's own work."
Mr Bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far.
"We can't all be Titians and we can't all be Darwins, he said; at the same time he doubted whether you could have your Darwin and your Titian if it weren't for humble people like ourselves."
"But he did not want compliments (most men do, she thought), and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures."
"Anyhow, said Lily, tossing off her little insincerity, she would always go on painting, because it interested her."
"Yes, said Mr Bankes, he was sure she would, and as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in London when they turned and saw the Ramsays."
"For she was wearing a green shawl, and they were standing close together watching Prue and Jasper throwing catches."
"And suddenly the meaning which, for no reason at all, as perhaps they are stepping out of the Tube or ringing a doorbell, descends on people, making them symbolical, making them representative, came upon them, and made them in the dusk standing, looking, the symbols of marriage, husband and wife."
"But still for a moment, though Mrs Ramsay greeted them with her usual smile (oh, she's thinking we're going to get married, Lily thought) and said, 'I have triumphed tonight,' meaning that for once Mr Bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly; still, for one moment, there was a sense of things having been blown apart, of space, of irresponsibility as the ball soared high, and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches."
"Mr Ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at Hume, who had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the Lord's Prayer, and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study."
"(Certainly, Nancy had gone with them, since Minta Doyle had asked it with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as Nancy made off, after lunch, to her attic, to escape the horror of family life."
For as they walked along the road to the cliff Minta kept on taking her hand.
"There was something, of course, that people wanted; for when Minta took her hand and held it, Nancy, reluctantly, saw the whole world spread out beneath her, as if it were Constantinople seen through a mist, and then, however heavy-eyed one might be, one must needs ask, 'Is that Santa Sofia?'"
'Is that the Golden Horn?'
She would jump straight into a stream and flounder across.
"He liked her rashness, but he saw that it would not do _ she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days."
"At the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming, which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course."
She thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby.
"Suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about Damn your eyes, damn your eyes."
"They all had to join in and sing the chorus, and shout out together: Damn your eyes, damn your eyes, but it would be fatal to let the tide come in and cover up all the good hunting-grounds before they got on to the beach."
"But it would not do altogether, this shouting and damning your eyes, Andrew felt, picking his way down the cliff, this clapping him on the back, and calling him 'old fellow' and all that; it would not altogether do."
It was the worst of taking women on walks.
"Once on the beach they separated, he going out on to the Pope's Nose, taking his shoes off, and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves; Nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves."
"She crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber-like sea anemones, who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock."
"Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down."
"And then, letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky, on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver upon the horizon, she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing, hypnotized, and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess (the pool had diminished again) flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body, her own life, and the lives of all the people in the world, for ever, to nothingess."
"And Andrew shouted that the sea was coming in, so she leapt splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right behind a rock and there oh heavens! in each other's arms were Paul and Minta! kissing probably."
"However, they both felt, it's not our fault."
There was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now.
"'We shall be cut off!' Minta shrieked, suddenly terrified."
The wretched Paul had to pacify her.
"The men (Andrew and Paul at once became manly, and different from usual) took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant Rayley's stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again."
There was nothing more that could be done now.
"They drew ahead together, Paul and Minta, and he comforted her, and said how famous he was for finding things."
Once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch.
He would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it.
"He began telling her, however, that he would certainly find it, and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn: it was lost: she knew that: she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon."
He would prove what he could do.
"As they turned by the crossroads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through, and he must tell someone _ Mrs Ramsay of course, for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done."
She had made him think he could do anything.
I expect it of you.
And so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows.
"The house was all lit up, and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full, and he said to himself, childishly, as he walked up the drive, Lights, lights, lights, and repeated in a dazed way, Lights, lights, lights, as they came into the house, staring about him with his face quite stiff."
"Well then, Nancy had gone with them, Mrs Ramsay supposed, wondering, as she put down a brush, took up a comb, and said 'Come in' to a tap at the door (Jasper and Rose came in), whether the fact that Nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would happen; it made it less likely, somehow, Mrs Ramsay felt, very irrationally, except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not probable."
"'Not for the Queen of England,' said Mrs Ramsay emphatically."
"'Not for the Empress of Mexico,' she added, laughing at Jasper; for he shared his mother's vice: he, too, exaggerated."
"She was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late; it was inconsiderate of them, and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about them, that they should choose this very night to be out late, when, in fact, she wished the dinner to be particularly nice, since William Bankes had at last consented to dine with them; and they were having Mildred's masterpiece _ Boeuf en Daube."
Everything depended upon things being served up the precise moment they were ready.
Jasper offered her an opal necklace; Rose a gold necklace.
"Every time, they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again, because, she thought, the old rook, the father rook, old Joseph was her name for him, was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition."
"He was a disreputable old bird, with half his wing feathers missing."
He was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a public house.
"Anyhow they all went up again, and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite scimitar shapes."
"The movement of the wings beating out, out, out _ she could never describe it accurately enough to please herself _ was one of the loveliest of all to her."
"The gold necklace, which was Italian, or the opal necklace, which Uncle James had brought her from India; or should she wear her amethysts?"
"'Choose, dearests, choose,' she said, hoping that they would make haste."
"But she let them take their time to choose: she let Rose, particularly, take up this and then that, and hold her jewels against the black dress, for this little ceremony of choosing jewels, which was gone through every night, was what Rose liked best, she knew."
"What was the reason, Mrs Ramsay wondered, standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen, divining, through her own past, some deep, some buried, some quite speechless feeling that one had for one's mother at Rose's age."
"And Rose would grow up; and Rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep feelings, and she said she was ready now, and they would go down, and Jasper, because he was the gentleman, should give her his arm, and Rose, as she was the lady, should carry her handkerchief (she gave her the handkerchief), and what else? oh, yes, it might be cold: a shawl."
Why did he want to shoot poor old Joseph and Mary?
"He shuffled a little on the stairs, and felt rebuked, but not seriously, for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds; that they did not feel; and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world, but he rather liked her stories about Mary and Joseph."
"But here, suddenly, like all grown-up people, she ceased to pay him the least attention."
"'They've come back!' she exclaimed, and at once she felt much more annoyed with them than relieved."
"And, like some queen who, finding her people gathered in the hall, looks down upon them, and descends among them, and acknowledges their tributes silently, and accepts their devotion and their prostration before her (Paul did not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed), she went down, and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly, as if she accepted what they could not say: their tribute to her beauty."
"Could they have let the Boeuf en Daube overboil, she wondered? pray heaven not! when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly, authoritatively, that all those scattered about, in attics, in bedrooms, on little perches of their own, reading, writing, putting the last smooth to their hair, or fastening dresses, must leave all that, and the little odds and ends on their washing-tables and dressing-tables and the novels on the bed-tables, and the diaries which were so private, and assemble in the dining-room for dinner."
"She had a sense of being past everything, through everything, out of everything, as she helped the soup, as if there was an eddy _ there _ and one could be in it, or one could be out of it, and she was out of it."
She forbore to look at Mr Tansley.
And the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her.
"Again she felt, as a fact without hostility, the sterility of men, for if she did not do it nobody would do it, and so, giving herself the little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped, the old familiar pulse began beating, as the watch begins ticking _ one, two, three, one, two, three."
"And so then, she concluded, addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to William Bankes _ poor man! who had no wife and no children, and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now strong enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea."
Lily Briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no-man's-land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon.
"Poor William Bankes, she seemed to be saying, as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people, and the life in her, her resolve to live again, had been stirred by pity."
"And it was not true, Lily thought; it was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people's."
He is not in the least pitiable.
"She remembered, all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure, that she too had her work."
"What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean, as if, Lily thought (he sat opposite to her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of his meals."
"She pitied men always as if they lacked _ something _ women never, as if they had something."
He had come down in his ordinary clothes.
He had not got any dress clothes.
'One never gets anything worth having by post' _ that was the sort of thing they were always saying.
They made men say that sort of thing.
He liked her; he admired her; he still thought of the man in the drain-pipe looking up at her; but he felt it necessary to assert himself.
"He was really, Lily Briscoe thought, in spite of his eyes, but then look at his nose, look at his hands, the most uncharming human being she had ever met."
He was in his old flannel trousers.
"But he was not going to be made a fool of by women, so he turned deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said, all in a jerk, very rudely, it would be too rough for her tomorrow."
But Mrs Ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to William Bankes.
"'It must have been fifteen _ no, twenty years ago _ that I last saw her,' she was saying, turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk, for she was absorbed by what they were saying."
"She says they're building a new billiard room,' he said."
Building a billiard room!
"'Oh,' said Mrs Ramsay with a little start, 'No, she added, reflecting that she did not know this Carrie who built a new billiard room."
"'People soon drift apart,' said Mr Bankes, feeling, however, some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the Mannings and the Ramsays."
"Well, thought William Bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table-cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's friends ask of one."
It would have hurt her if he had refused to come.
"Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of time."
"'I wish one of you would run up to Roger's room,' Mrs Ramsay was saying."
Here he sat drumming his fingers on the table-cloth when he might have been _ he took a flashing bird's-eye view of his work.
What a waste of time it all was to be sure!
"Yet, he thought, she is one of my oldest friends."
"Yet now, at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him: her beauty meant nothing to him; her sitting with her little boy at the window _ nothing, nothing."
"It was in this sort of state that one asked oneself, 'What does one live for?"
"But here he was asking himself that sort of question, because Mrs Ramsay was giving orders to servants, and also because it had struck him, thinking how surprised Mrs Ramsay was that Carrie Manning should still exist, that friendships, even the best of them, are frail things."
"He felt rigid and barren, like a pair of boots that has been soaked and gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them."
"Unless he were very careful, she would find out this treachery of his; that he did not care a straw for her, and that would not be at all pleasant, he thought."
"So, when there is a strife of tongues at some meeting, the chairman, to obtain unity, suggests that everyone shall speak in French."
"Replying to her in the same language, Mr Bankes said, 'No, not at all,' and Mr Tansley, who had no knowledge of this language, even spoken thus in words of one syllable, at once suspected its insincerity."
"They did talk nonsense, he thought, the Ramsays; and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy, making a note which, one of these days, he would read aloud, to one or two friends."
He wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself.
Lily Briscoe knew all that.
